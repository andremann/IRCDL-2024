However, the software used in these projects was adapted using a series of ad-hoc solutions, hence becoming difficult to maintain and to further extend with new functionality.

Candidate Annotation: they annotate the candidate keyphrases with information from different knowledge domains, such as statistics (e.g. number of occurrences of the candidate, length of the candidate, . . . ), linguistics (number of nouns in the candidate [19], anaphors that have the candidate as antecedent [2], . . . ), or from external knowledge (e.g. Wikipedia [3]), and so on; 5. Candidate Scoring: they score the candidates using the annotations produced in the previous steps. The score can be calculated using simple, handcrafted techniques [3,19] or using machine learning algorithms [2].","refs":[{"start":159,"end":162,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b1"},{"start":162,"end":165,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b18"},{"start":427,"end":431,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b18"},{"start":480,"end":483,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b1"},{"start":537,"end":540,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b2"},{"start":721,"end":724,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b2"},{"start":724,"end":727,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b18"},{"start":765,"end":768,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b1"}]},{"text":"Some annotators are already provided out-of-the-box.

DL) techniques are attacking \"classical\" machine learning approaches in many fields, outperforming them in many tasks. For example, in the Machine Translation domain, the WMT 2016 task saw a surge of Neural Machine Translation systems, which vastly outperformed the syntax-based systems presented in the previous edition [6,7]. The same happened in the ImageNet competition, where the introduction of DL techniques brought the error rate down to 3,6% from the previous, pre-\"Deep Learning era\" 26,1% state-of-the art [13]. DL approaches also improved the state of the art in many other fields, such as speech recognition and image segmentation, and are currently regarded of obtaining \"superhuman\" performance in traffic sign classification [13].","refs":[{"start":362,"end":365,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b5"},{"start":365,"end":367,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b6"},{"start":558,"end":562,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b12"},{"start":782,"end":786,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b12"}]},{"text":"DL techniques have been developed also for AKE [25], Named Entity Recognition [23], and many other NLP tasks with very promising results. This will prove a challenge for systems designed to be knowledge-based like the Distiller framework. However, there are tasks where the \"classic\" knowledge-based approach is still dominant, as NER and Concept Recognition in specialized fields, due to the need of binding concepts to specialized ontologies [4]. In these cases, where algorithms need to take into account rare words that DL models often fail to recognize, we believe systems like the Distiller still has much to offer to the research community. In addition we believe that, due to the extensible framework architecture of Distiller, our system will continue to be useful in the future, e.g. by integrating deep learning libraries inside it. For example, the popular Tensorflow [1] library offers Java APIs, so it would be easy to integrate it in our system. In the future, our goal is to use the Distiller framework to develop an hybrid approach for AKE, which takes into account both the \"classic\" supervised features, along with the new, DL based techniques.","refs":[{"start":47,"end":51,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b24"},{"start":78,"end":82,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b22"},{"start":444,"end":447,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b3"},{"start":880,"end":883,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b0"}]}]}],"tables":{},"abstract":{"title":"Abstract","paragraphs":[{"text":"In 2015, we introduced a novel knowledge extraction framework called the Distiller Framework, with the goal of offering the research community a flexible, multilingual information extraction framework [3].","refs":[]},{"text":"Two years later, the project has significantly evolved, by supporting more languages and many machine learning algorithms.
