Hence, the urgency of a global sharing of multicultural heritage: an activity made easier by technology that can create semi-automatic solutions to enhance the readability of documents, comprehend their content, preserve it through time and enable advanced digital use with sophisticated consultation and search functions.","refs":[]},{"text":"The challenges of devising automated information extraction solutions when dealing with non-Latin materials w.r.t Latin ones are essentially of two main orders: from one hand the graphic-linguistic and on the other hand the advancement of the state of the art for the Arabic script OCR. From the graphic-linguistic point of view the Arabic script is always cursive, reads from right to left, homographic (the majority of its graphemes are distinguished merely by one, two, or three diacritical dots above or below them), consonantic (abÇ§ad, vowels are exclusively represented by diacritical signs). Moreover the shape of graphemes varies depending on the context and some of those don't bind leftward, resulting in words with two or more components joined without any ligature. From the State of the Art perspective, the studies on Latin script gained more attention with respect to Arabic, due mainly to the aforementioned graphic challenges. In fact, only in the last two decades more attention has been posed on the question even though Arabic OCR systems still perform poorly compared to Latin script OCRs. [1] This is the challenging scenario of ITSERR1 , a NextGenerationEU-funded project through the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR) started in November 2022 with the goal of enhancing the European Research Infrastructure RESILIENCE [2] in response to the demands of the scientific community in Religious Studies, supporting the current national infrastructures and elevating it to a more mature state in terms of technology integration and capacity to increase innovation, quality and variety of the knowledge produced by the field of Religious Studies. The premise of ITSERR is that the humanities would provide extremely diversified datasets whose complexity will challenge technological experts and ICT researchers. The development of digital tools will concern both instruments for text editions through a historical-critical approach as well as tools designed to support each phase of the research in the field of Religious Studies. Digital Maktaba (in Arabic \"maktaba\", \"library\": the \"place where books are located\", henceforth DM), which started as a Proof of Concept in collaboration with the Foundation for Religious Studies (FSCIRE), a national infrastructure located in Bologna and Palermo and the innovative startup mim.FSCIRE [3,4], will be a research project carried out within ITSERR. It is part of the RESILIENCE framework and is intended to offer a helpful and innovative solution to libraries specialised in religious studies that need to manage multilingual and multi-alphabetic cultural heritage documents. In particular, its goal and expected contributions are the following:","refs":[{"start":1111,"end":1114,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b0"},{"start":1157,"end":1158,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_0"},{"start":1352,"end":1355,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b1"},{"start":2360,"end":2363,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b2"},{"start":2363,"end":2365,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b3"}]},{"text":"â¢ DM aims to develop intelligent extraction and data management processes, to help managing libraries and archives and to create virtuous cataloguing models that can handle non-Latin alphabets documents.

We are aware of very few noteworthy projects within the languages taken into consideration, compared to other automation challenges (e.g. automatic extraction of metadata, semi-automated cataloguing with Machine Learning approaches). In 2009 the Alexandria library created the Arabic Digital Library as a part of the Digital Assets Repository (DAR) project, with text extraction tools for Arabic language characters implemented [5]. Another similar project is Arabic Collections Online, a multi-institutional project mainly aiming to digitize, preserve and provide free open access to a wide variety of Arabic language books on various subjects [6]. From a more strict digitization standpoint it is worth to mention other few important projects on Arabic and Persian manuscripts that involve handwritten text recognition, such as The British Library projects on arabic [7][8] and persian manuscripts [9][10]. More recently, similar projects concerning the digitization and the building of Arabic and Persian text corpora have been developed, such as the Open Islamicate Text Initiative (OpenITI) [11], which is a multi-institutional effort to construct the first machine-actionable scholarly corpus of premodern Islamicate texts collected from open-access online libraries such as Shamela [12] and Shiaonline library [13]. From a character recognition standpoint, the OpenITI project expolits the Kraken OCR useful both for handwritten and printed text recognition [14,15]. Two further intriguing initiatives from OpenITI are KITAB [16] and the Persian Digital Library (PDL) [17]. The first one is focused on discovering the relationship in the Arabic rich textual tradition with interesting Machine Learning (ML) solutions such as stylometric analysis [18] and subgenre classification [19]. The latter is focused on building a scholarly-verified corpus and an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system for handwritten Persian texts. PDL has already created an open-access corpus of Persian poems collected from the Ganjoor site [20] and integrated with a lemmatizer [21] and a digital Persian dictionary [22]. Most of the above-mentioned projects aim to fully digitize a (relatively) small library of books, frequently involving a significant amount of manual labor or only focusing on a tiny subset of the languages taken into account by DM. Additionally, DM will enable the extraction of a rich array of metadata rather than just text content, fully supporting non-latin alphabet metadata.","refs":[{"start":748,"end":751,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b4"},{"start":965,"end":968,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b5"},{"start":1189,"end":1192,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b6"},{"start":1220,"end":1223,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b8"},{"start":1416,"end":1420,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b10"},{"start":1609,"end":1613,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b11"},{"start":1637,"end":1641,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b12"},{"start":1785,"end":1789,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b13"},{"start":1789,"end":1792,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b14"},{"start":1852,"end":1856,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b15"},{"start":1895,"end":1899,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b16"},{"start":2073,"end":2077,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b17"},{"start":2106,"end":2110,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b18"},{"start":2350,"end":2354,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b19"},{"start":2388,"end":2392,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b20"},{"start":2426,"end":2430,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b21"}]}]},{"title":"Digital Maktaba project description","paragraphs":[{"text":"The project is composed by two macro-phases:","refs":[]}]},{"title":"a.

The considered OCR tools are the ones that have been selected in our preliminary analyses as the ones best supporting the involved languages: they are EasyOCR2 , GoogleDocs3 and Tesseract 4 . \"DM\" represents the proof of concept solution that exploits multiple OCR engines and automatically selects the results that are found to be more promising (also exploiting self-assessed quality scores relying on external linguistic resources such as the Open Multilingual WordNet thesauri 5 ). The evaluation was performed through an ad-hoc metric we defined to take into consideration both the output quality (oq in a range [0,2]), based on the actual correspondence with ground truth defined by experts, and the input quality (iq, range [0,2]), based on a manually assessed quality of the scan/image: qdiff (range [-2,2]) simply expresses the relationship between output quality w.r.t. input quality, where 0 indicates in line, a positive value equals higher than input quality, a negative value equals lower than input quality results:","refs":[{"start":578,"end":581,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b2"},{"start":581,"end":583,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b3"},{"start":717,"end":718,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_0"},{"start":1007,"end":1008,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_1"},{"start":1021,"end":1022,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_2"},{"start":1037,"end":1038,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_3"},{"start":1330,"end":1331,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_4"}]},{"text":"The qdiff equation's core principle is to penalize the OCR results when input quality is higher and output quality is lower. The resulting values allow us not only to compare the systems' performance (the higher the better), but also to have an idea whether the quality of the output is better or worse than expectations. As we can see from Figure 1 (left), the quality of the freely available OCR engines is very much dependent on the language, and there is no engine that is superior to others for all the considered languages. Instead, the experiments revealed that the combined DM approach is able to give better results in terms of overall output quality. Moreover, DM is actually designed to extract the additional metadata described in Section 3, while available solutions often focus on bare text / text regions extraction.","refs":[{"start":348,"end":349,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_0"}]},{"text":"Another test we present is about a specific problem that has been preliminarily analyzed, the sorting and merging of the text regions (boxes) extracted by OCR tools (part of the syntactic metadata extraction). The output offered by available tools is often not ordered correctly w.r.t. the meaning and reading rules (e.g., right to left) of the specific languages, moreover in some cases phrases are fragmented into different boxes. These problems can lead to low metadata quality and increased complexity of the subsequent knowledge extraction phases. A preliminary ad-hoc algorithm has been developed in order to solve the above-mentioned issues: it exploits the positions of the text boxes in order to perform horizontal grouping, merging, and renumbering of the boxes. Figure 1 (right part) shows the performance increase obtained by applying this approach. Performances are evaluated on two metrics w.r.t. a gold standard manually determined by experts: average percentage correctness -the percentage of boxes in each document having the right number, averaged on the whole document set, and percentage of correctly sorted documents -the percentage of documents without errors in the numbering of their boxes. As we can see, thanks to the current algorithm implementation, the average percentage correctness increases by 14%, while the percentage of correctly sorted documents increases by 30%, going from 68% to 98%.","refs":[{"start":780,"end":781,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_0"}]}]},{"title":"Conclusion","paragraphs":[{"text":"As discussed in the previous sections, several advantages on a variety of interesting and innovative fronts are expected. First of all, from a broader standpoint, studies on cataloguing in contexts involving many languages should advance without relying exclusively on perplexing transliteration schemes. As the proof of concept already hinted, DM aims to overcome the current limitations in terms of text extraction over different non-latin languages, allowing the direct use of the documents' native language. Moreover, library services will be strengthened thanks to the design and implementation of intelligent features for user assistance as well as the exploitation of other available library catalogs. This will enable a faster cataloguing pipeline and, not less important, greater data consistency (also through time). Moreover, there will also be improvements in areas such as flexibility of data output/exchange, and explainability of the assistance techniques.","refs":[]},{"text":"Overall, the project multidisciplinary and multicultural nature has the potential to significantly improve cultural heritage preservation and exploitation, thanks to a tool that is part of a broader shared-knowledge framework (ITSERR), encompassing various languages, cultures, and religious realities.","refs":[]}]}],"tables":{},"abstract":{"title":"Abstract","paragraphs":[{"text":"The services provided by today's cutting-edge digital library systems may benefit from new technologies that can improve cataloguing efficiency and cultural heritages preservation and accessibility. Below, we introduce the recently started Digital Maktaba (DM) project, which suggests a new model for the knowledge extraction and semi-automatic cataloguing task in the context of digital libraries that contain documents in non-Latin scripts (e.g. Arabic). Since DM involves a large amount of unorganized data from several sources, particular emphasis will be placed on topics such as big data integration, big data analysis and long-term preservation. This project aims to create an innovative workflow for the automatic extraction of information and metadata and for a semi-automated cataloguing process by exploiting Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Artificial Intelligence and data management techniques to provide a system that is capable of speeding up, enhancing and supporting the librarian's work. We also report on some promising results that we obtained through a preliminary proof of concept experimentation. (Short paper, discussion paper","refs":[]}]}}
