The completeness metric reports the percentage of non-empty values. The accuracy metric is computed by verifying how many textual geographical fields (such as municipalities) are correctly reconciled with Wikidata towns or municipalities.

This effort resulted in 87 high-quality Open Datasets freely available on CKAN (𝑃 2 , 𝑃 3 ). Topics span from tangible and intangible CH, natural heritage, gastronomic curiosities, and information of public interest. This remarkable result is attributable to the effort of the HETOR project to propose structured activities built around the collaborative platform SPOD and a meticulous search for the data to be modeled to digitize CH of the Campania region. All the datasets are published as CSV attached to the Creative Commons License. Since different communities author them over time, they have no uniform schema (𝐿 1 , 𝐿 2 ). Published datasets might take advantage by proposing a uniform schema, such as an ontology, for each dataset group. Moreover, datasets are manually curated (𝐿 3 ). Hence, they contain inaccurate values that can be easily corrected by automatic data quality approaches, such as clustering approaches to detect and correct typos, or by reconciling values with the ones published in well-known Knowledge Graphs, such as Wikidata. Further effort should be invested in quantifying the coherence and the coverage with respect to the covered topics.","refs":[]}]}],"tables":{"tab_0":{"heading":"Table 1 :","description":"Overview of Open datasets co-created within the HETOR project.","rows":[["Dataset details","","Quantitative info","Qualitative info"],["Name","Author","Rows Cols Cells CMP.","ACC."],["Tangible Cultural Heritage -Immovable Cultural Heritage",""],["Castels and coast towers","Hetor","523","31 16213","45%","96%"],["Rock cults","Hetor","88","25","2200","50%","82%"],["Theatres and odeons","Hetor","32","27","864","77%","87%"],["Noble palaces in Fisciano","Assoc.","22","16","352","89%","100%"],["Churches and art in Calitri","School","64","19","1216","86%","97%"],["Cilento resources","Hetor","145","5","725","98%","87%"],["Abandoned factories","School","69","23","1587","72%","99%"],["CH of San Nicola la Strada","School","22","13","286","83%","100%"],["Calitri buldings","School","27","18","486","75%","100%"],["Novera Inferiore Itineraries","School","49","14","686","98%","98%"],["Agrometeorological network","School","33","12","396","92%","70%"],["Collina del Parco risk map","Assoc.","8","13","104","70%","-"],["Caserta contemporary itineraries","School","31","16","496","98%","94%"],["Caserta modern itineraries","School","31","14","434","100%","100%"],["Caserta medieval itineraries","School","42","16","672","99%","93%"],["Capua & Aversa Churches","School","133","20","2660","57%","94%"],["Agriculture assistance centres","School","161","10","1610","99%","89%"],["Clinical records of Psychiatric Hos-","Assoc.","200","10","2000","90%","86%"],["pital in Nocera Inferiore","","","","","",""],["Bio companies","School","203","16","3248 100 %","89%"],["Solidarity Purchasing Groups","School","29","12","377","99%","85%"],["Didactic farms","School","267","14","3738","99%","-"],["Gate crests of Nocera Inferiore","Assoc.","9","7","63","70%","-"],["Nocera Inferiore votive shrines","Assoc.","49","12","588","74%","-"],["Photografic Safari @Paestum","School &","115","9","1035","98%","100%"],["","Assoc.","","","","",""],["Touring club","Assoc.","29","19","551","72%","97%"],["Avellino POI","School","1439","13 18707","83%","99%"],["Caserta POI","School","1314","13 17082","81%","100%"],["Nocerino -Sarnese POI","School","285","13","3705","82%","99%"],["Artistic High Schools","Assoc.","36","37","1332","92%","94%"],["Museums of Cilento and the Gulf","School","69","17","1173","68%","93%"],["of Policastro","","","","","",""],["Hidden treasures","Assoc.","83","50","4150","77%","96%"],["Tangible Cultural Heritage -Movable Cultural Heritage",""],["Trademarks","School","32","43","1376","98%","58%"],["Peasant civilization","School","196","14","2744","87%","-"],["Open Museum","School","213","18","3834","90%","-"],["Irpino Museum: Epigraphs","School","11","53","583","93%","91%"]]},"tab_1":{"heading":"Discussion: Potentialities 𝑃 𝑥 and Limitations 𝐿 𝑦 𝑃 1 -Joint effort.","description":"Since 2016, HETOR has collaborated with three communities, associations, schools, and local PAs, with 27 agencies and 702 users. It demonstrates that the HETOR project is a joint effort of data lovers, experts in the field, citizens, and learners in co-creating content as OD. The biggest community in terms of agencies is the association one, with 14 joining agencies. It involves volunteers, data experts, and data lovers. 𝑃 2 -Consistent OD co-creation effort. The HETOR project co-authored 87 datasets concerning CH in the Campania Region since 2016. It is worth noting that the dataset collection presented in this article is a subset of the published datasets as we focus only on local CH in our Region. Looking at Table1, it is evident that datasets differ in size and topics, covering all the aspects of CH, i.e., tangible and intangible heritage, natural heritage, and food and wine. They also cover other topics relevant for citizens, such as companies, associations, and geographical information in the Campania Region. The same topic is modeled in different areas of the Campania Region, such as itineraries, and points of interest (POI), to guarantee a wider geographical coverage. 𝑃 3 -High-quality OD. As made evident by the CMP. column of Table1, the completeness percentage of the HETOR datasets is overall very high. Only in 10 out 87 cases, the percentage is lower than 75% of the dataset. It is worth clarifying that the reported count non-empty cells. In some datasets, authors explicitly report missing information that does not affect the reported value. Moreover, according to the ACC. column of Table1, the accuracy score of the geographical information is very high. It is always less than 70% in only 4 out of 87 datasets. It means that published datasets can be considered high-quality 𝐿 1 -Tabular OD. All the authored datasets are published as CSV. They are the best way to publish independent datasets, not yet interlinked. Modeling data as tables forces the data publisher to represent all the entries with the same structure, causing empty values for not applicable columns or the use of lists in a single cell. By exploiting the Semantic Web technologies, any entry can be modeled with an arbitrary number of relations. 𝐿 2 -No uniform schema. The datasets differ for schema, in terms of the amount and the type of modelled columns, and lack a uniform terminology in the column headers. Before modeling a unified schema, it is suggested to carefully check the datasets' content to avoid modeling columns that are declared as headers, but contain no data. 𝐿 3 -Inaccurate values due to manual input. The datasets are manually curated. Hence, typos, improper use of apostrophes as accents, and misspelled words are common errors. It causes the deficiency observed in the datasets accuracy. Moreover, string facets in Open Refine detected non-uniform use of lower and upper-case, switched letters, wide use of acronyms, and improper usage of apostrophes and accents.","rows":[]}},"abstract":{"title":"Abstract","paragraphs":[{"text":"Open Data are published to encourage their exploitation, but limited technical skills are a crucial barrier. Initiatives to let learners in particular and users in general exploit Open Data are rare in literature, and they mainly focus on the exploitation phase rather than the authoring one. To increase Open Data awareness and move users in the position of open data curators, the HETOR project regularly organise workshops to let participants create, publish, and exploit Open Data. This project started in 2016 and resulted in the co-creation of dozens of high-quality open datasets, publicly available on CKAN, involving hundreds of learners, public administration delegates, and volunteers in associations. This article describes the involved communities within the HETOR project and quantitatively and qualitatively details authored datasets covering any aspect of Cultural Heritage in the Campania Region.","refs":[]}]}}
