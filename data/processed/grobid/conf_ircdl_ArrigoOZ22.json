In the main part of the screen it is presented the card with the character, in a cartoon-like fashion.

The player can perform her/his choice by using the swipe gesture. A preview of the choice appears, in the form of texts saying \"yes\" or \"not\", which the player has to confirm in order to let her/him possibly revise the decision.

This choice required a preliminary analysis of the recent activities at national (i.e. Italian) and international level. Starting from the museums official websites, we analyzed events, exhibitions, social campaigns and educational activities for different audiences. After selecting a number of potential activities, we assigned each one to the most related professionals and developed a short narrative in the form of a colloquial text to be inserted in a balloon above the character.","refs":[]},{"text":"We have currently created twenty proposals for MuseLapse, evenly distributed among the six characters. Proposal may regard the organization of a scientific conference within the museum (by the conservator), the loan of exhibits for a temporary exhibition organized abroad (by the registrar), the creation of a social game based on the collection (by the communication expert), the organization of a special event about dance in the early ages (by the marketing expert) and the launch of a yoga course inside the museum (by the education manager). All these activities have actually been organized by at least one real museum and published on its website.

The name of this resource refers to as Laurus nobilis, or laurel, a plant that in Classical culture represented knowledge. The longer s/he maintains his role as museum director, the more Lauros s/he is able to get. So, the player earns points at each choice, the more the three indexes are balanced the higher the amount of points.

When an index goes below zero the game ends, corresponding to the director being fired. The value of the indexes is clipped to 6 even in case of very positive results of a scenario. The role of luck is modulated, because scenarios are not equally probable. For instance, as it can be seen in Table 1, accepting a proposal can have a very likely scenario (the first), one less likely but still plausible scenario (the second) and a third highly unlikely scenario (the third) that makes the game more challenging.","refs":[{"start":450,"end":451,"marker":"table","target":null}]},{"text":"The probability of these three scenarios is set accordingly to their likelihood and may change over time when the player improves her/his competences in gameplay.

The University of Padua participates to Researchers' Night since the first edition, and the Department of Cultural Heritage has often presented new ways to access and disseminate the results of its research activities.","refs":[]},{"text":"In this occasion we installed a beta version of the application in a set of mobile devices and make visitors able to try the game. Their aim was to obtain the maximum number of Lauros, maintaining the role of a museum director for the highest number of turns. Several people tried the game, both children and adults. Participants were able to play the game more than once, providing that there were enough mobile devices available. It is important to note that, in this particular occasion, the game was slightly modified. Since each participant might have a reduced amount of time to play the game, each proposal was presented only once, allowing her/him to complete the game without failing. In the standard version of game, each proposal can be presented several times because it may correspond to different scenarios, and thus MuseLapse is a true endless game. Anyway, only one participant completed the game without failing","refs":[]},{"text":"We asked each participant to provide an informal feedback, in order to obtain first impression to adjust the development of the game. All participants found the game interesting and enjoyable, praising the idea of introducing the museum activities and their risks in a fun way. Some proposals and scenarios have been commented by participants, mostly when they recognized the similarity with personal experiences during past visits to museums. Some suggested to make the game more predictable, because the outcome of a choice are not always easy to forecast. To this end, we plan to add an indication about the possible effects of a single choice on the three indexes.","refs":[]}]},{"title":"Conclusions and Future Work","paragraphs":[{"text":"This paper presents the serious game MuseLapse which, although being straightforward to play, is based on real cases and provides the player with relevant information on organization of the museum, the activities that can be carried out and their possible outcomes.","refs":[]},{"text":"MuseLapse has been developed as part of a larger project called Memo -The Memory of Objects that aims at raising interest towards the problems of authentication of museum exhibits. One of the results is another serious game, called FakeMuse [19], where the player has the role of a curator internship in a fictional archaeological museum with the aim to increase the exhibits collection. To accomplish it the player has to understand if a set of proposed artifacts are authentic or not. In addition to this main task, the player can read a sort of tidbits magazine and play with a set of minigames. One of these minigames will be MuseLapse that, besides being a standalone game, can be added to the economic resource system of the FakeMuse.","refs":[{"start":241,"end":245,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b18"}]},{"text":"Future work will address a quantitative evaluation of MuseLapse with a larger set of real players. One part of the evaluation will be carried out through the analysis of game logs, in order to measure the length of each round of the game, the time required to make a decision and to refine accordingly the game mechanics. Additionally, we will analyze whether playing the game is entertaining or not and, at the same time, if it reaches the goal of raising awareness on the complex structure of museum activities and on the role of professionals. Questionnaires could be submit to players, in addition to the logs analysis, in order to assess this last issue. We are planning to add new characters that will not have an effect on the economy of the game in term of variation of the three parameters, but to make the game more engaging and to improve the game experience. Examples are the postman and the courier, which deliver some letters or packages, or an university professor that invite the director/player to a seminar or a congress. Finally, to make the rules game easier to understand we are planning to design a tutorial session in which player can understand the mechanisms of the game and its aims.","refs":[]}]}],"tables":{},"abstract":{"title":"Abstract","paragraphs":[{"text":"This paper presents MuseLapse, a serious game for mobile devices about museums, their activities and the professional skills required to manage them.
