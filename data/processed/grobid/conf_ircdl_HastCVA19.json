This is because parts of the retrieved words may be similar to some part of the query word, or a word may share several characters with other words, and hence generate false positives [30]. The partitioning step is followed by a nearest neighbor search which is performed in an optimal sliding window within the subgroups of the detected keypoints. The extent of the matching points in a word is thus computed using a simple keypoint matching algorithm, that also captures words that are partially outside the sliding window. The resultant correspondences between the query word and the retrieved word needs further refinement due to the presence of potential outliers. To do so, a deterministic preconditioner [32] is used, and the matching algorithm efficiently captures complex variations in handwriting. An advantage of the proposed method is that it is completely learning-free, which means no prior knowledge about the text is required and word searching can be performed on a non-annotated dataset as well.

The preliminary tests are performed on the images from the Alvin repository and the Clavius on the Web. Uppsala University Library. Referring to Fig. 2a, a query word Berlin has been marked by a user and denoted using red bounding box. The extent of the query word Berlin is automatically corrected by the algorithm, so that the word is perfectly encapsulated, and is represented using green bounding box. Figure 2b highlights several instances of the word Berlin found in the pages by Karin Boye, and it can be seen that all these founds words have been accurately identified by the proposed word spotter. Figure 2c presents some sample words that are very similar in characteristic with the word Berlin, and have been rejected by the word spotter (as intended). Furthermore, Fig. 3 presents some qualitative results obtained from the proposed training-free word spotter, with retrieved instances of the query word Berlin represented in blue bounding box. The next set of experiments are performed on the digitised images of letters from the correspondence of Christopher Clavius, that are preserved by the Historical Archives of the Pontifical Gregorian University (Refer to the Clavius on the Web project [8]). For example, Fig. 4 highlights word spotting results for letters written by Galileo Galilei in Florence 1588, to Christopher Clavius in Rome. In total, pages of two letters by Galilei have been taken into account. In Fig. 4a, a query word f irenze has been marked by a user (in red bounding box), automatically corrected to perfectly fit the word in green bounding box. Figure 4c presents the retrieved instances of the query word f irenze on 2 different letters, which have been accurately identified by the proposed word spotter. Interestingly, no word output has been rejected by the word spotter. However, there has been found an instance where the query word is missed by the word spotter due to high level of bleed-through in the document, and has been presented in Fig. 4c. This needs to be further investigated, and proposed word spotter can be further improved in future work. Usually, some amount of garbage words are found and we are currently investigating techniques to decrease the amount of such words that would only be irritating for the user. In the presented cases the algorithm was able to remove all such words, but unfortunately they are quite common, especially for shorter words. The words chosen here were names of cities as it belongs to the class of information usually interesting for historians and other users.","refs":[{"start":290,"end":292,"marker":"figure","target":null},{"start":553,"end":555,"marker":"figure","target":null},{"start":754,"end":756,"marker":"figure","target":null},{"start":922,"end":923,"marker":"figure","target":null},{"start":1372,"end":1373,"marker":"figure","target":null},{"start":1576,"end":1578,"marker":"figure","target":null},{"start":1731,"end":1733,"marker":"figure","target":null},{"start":2131,"end":2133,"marker":"figure","target":null}]}]},{"title":"Conclusion","paragraphs":[{"text":"This paper presented a training-free word spotting method to facilitate fast, accurate and reliable transcription of historical handwritten documents available in digital repositories (such as Alvin and Clavius on the Web project). The word spotter efficiently finds multiple occurrences of a query word on-the-fly in a collection of historical document images. The preliminary experiments on sample images from Alvin and Clavius on the Web demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed word spotter.","refs":[]},{"text":"As future work, the aim is to develop a state-of-the-art comprehensive transcription tool to accelerate the time consuming transcription process using advanced HTR technology, incorporated with expert user feedback in the loop.

A vast majority of this material has not been transcribed yet, owing to technological challenges and lack of expertise. This renders the task of making these historical collections available for public access challenging, especially in performing a simple text search across the collection. Machine learning based methods for handwritten text recognition are gaining importance these days, which require huge amount of pretranscribed texts for training the system. However, it is impractical to have access to several thousands of pre-transcribed documents due to adversities transcribers face. Therefore, this paper presents a trainingfree word spotting algorithm as an alternative for handwritten text transcription, where case studies on Alvin (Swedish repository) and Clavius on the Web are presented. The main focus of this work is on discussing prospects of making materials in the Alvin platform and Clavius on the Web easily searchable using a word spotting based handwritten text recognition system.","refs":[]}]}}
