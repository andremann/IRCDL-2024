In order to achieve the desired integration of digital libraries within CNR's information system it is crucial to take into account the existing situation, which features multiple and distributed repositories.

Obviously this change have to be introduced by gathering inputs and consensus from CNR's scientific network. Needless to say that all the technical solutions have to be based on open standards and open source platforms. With respect to this point, it is worth mentioning that CNR's information systems have started more than ten years ago a process of migration towards open source solutions, shifting the investments from commercial products to highly skilled personnel.

For example, if a resource has an assigned DOI, it may still be useful to assign an NBN to it, because the latter type of PI has a syntax that facilitates accounting tasks (e.g. grouping and counting resources by sub-domain). In this cases it is useful to make provisions for easy retrieval of the previously assigned identifier. In our opinion there are two main ways for achieving this result: the first is to include the previously assigned PI in the final part of the NBN, the second is to include it in the metadata set. Both solutions have advantages and drawbacks. The first allow for easy retrieval of the alternate PI but may violate local policies for NBN generation and can be used for only one additional and pre-existing PI. The second makes it less immediate to retrieve the alternate PI but does not interfere in the NBN generation process.

Comparison of hash codes allow detecting bitwise equality but if two files differ for a single bit, they are considered different entities.
