We have listed below some of these by year and description in table 1. In [39], the authors provide an overview of current systems and techniques for visualizing LD but with a less detailed discussion. The authors identified six classification categories, some independent of each other, while we focused on the three categories representing each tool for LD visualization and exploration. In [41], semantic portals have been categorized conceptually into three generations: portals for search and browsing, portals with tools for distant reading and portals for serendipitous knowledge discovery. The authors focused more on the purposes of use than connecting the uses with the primary interfaces' characteristics. [40] overviews 16 existing tools in three categories, classified according to 16 criteria. The first Figure 2: Semantic web interfaces category represents the LD browsers; the second represents domain-specific and cross-domain recommenders; the third represents the exploratory search systems. In [46], the authors perform a focus group examination. They aim to determine the users' needs and system requirements for visualizing LD using the dashboard approach. The authors highlight the heterogeneity of LD and the need for highly customized visualizations for various kinds of LD. In [45], authors have surveyed existing tooling for LD consumption for non-technical end-users and presented general requirements for end-user LD platforms, encompassing a variety of topics, such as dataset discovery and data manipulation. In [47], authors present the available techniques for visualizing large linked datasets and the systems that implement them. They identify seven categories of LD interfaces: semantic browsers; graph-based visualization systems; hierarchical visualization systems; SPARQL endpoint visualization tools; facet browsers; query writers, and schema extraction. Existing works tend to classify link data interfaces by usage purposes and knowledge graph (KG) visualization manners, not categorizing them by characteristics common to all LD exploration and visualization interfaces. For this reason, we propose the analysis of some tools that are representative of each category that belongs to each of them with obviously different specifications. We are talking about the interaction paradigm used, which includes how the KG is shown to the user. The type of information displayed indicates what type of data, models, or information conversion functions the specific interface being analyzed uses. The strategy of reducing the information displayed that each interface uses to overcome the problems of loading the multitude of information contained in the knowledge base that the interfaces query. Below we will analyze each category identified, referring to the analysis of tools that we believe are representative of the paradigm, information, and strategy described.","refs":[{"start":155,"end":156,"marker":"table","target":"#tab_0"},{"start":161,"end":165,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b38"},{"start":480,"end":484,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b40"},{"start":804,"end":808,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b39"},{"start":912,"end":913,"marker":"figure","target":null},{"start":1101,"end":1105,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b45"},{"start":1390,"end":1394,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b44"},{"start":1630,"end":1634,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b46"}]}]},{"title":"Visualization of semantic data","paragraphs":[{"text":"The extracted semantics can be extremely useful for exploring a corpus of documents, but they are not fixed and homogeneous like a set of predefined metadata.

These efforts lately contributed to the emergence of KGs to organize complex data-sets integrating multiple sources [10,6]. In a visualization scenario, users are expected to be interested in finding specific resources and exploring something exciting and valuable without knowing what they are looking for until they identify it (serendipity effect). In this case, users perform a sequence of operations (e.g., queries) in which each operation's result determines the next operation's formulation. In this context, many user interfaces for visualization and exploration of KGs exist, and new ones are being developed every year, especially using semantic web and LD technologies [9,5,7,2].

At the moment, few interfaces combine the different paradigms, and this can be a good point to focus on to improve the browsing experience of digital library content. Information reduction strategies are present in most tools and are crucial for exploring complex KGs. However, while there are different tools and paradigms for data exploration, it is an open challenge to support the creation and exploration of data models by domain experts who may not possess a strong technical background on ontologies and RDF.","refs":[]}]}],"tables":{"tab_0":{"heading":"Table 1 :","description":"Related work","rows":[["work","year","description"],["S.
