This is maybe due to the wider accessibility of scientific research products when shared using Open Access instruments [1][2][3][4]. For scientific research products we intend here a various range of outcomes (and inputs) from a research project such as, for example, scientific data, research ideas, metadata, experimental results, etc. The EcoNAOS project [5] (which stays for Ecological North Adriatic Open Science Observatory System) is based on the testing and application of Open Science principles in marine long term ecological research. The principles we want to put the accent on are: free access to scientific research, research reproducibility, use of all available knowledge at early stage, sharing knowledge as early as possible [6] which could lead to social and economical benefits (ideas producers are also users, enabling new working models, new social relationships, saving money and time [7,8]), other than increase transparency of research and make cooperation between researchers as easy as possible. These principles are known and accepted at international level, and more specifically by the European Union, which defines the guidelines for Open Science application in scientific research and the FAIR principles applied to research data management [9]: data must be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR). Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) is a branch of ecological research aiming at collecting ecological data, from decadal to centennial scale, to understand environmental changes across the globe detecting trends, preventing and solving environmental and socio-ecological problems through question and problem-driven research. This data is collected and shared, when possible, by international network (ILTER) composed by ecological sites over four continents. Sites are then grouped and managed both at continent scale (eLTER) and national scale (LTER-Italy).

Moreover, data from this zone is diverse in typology (single point observations, time series, samples collected in field or analyzed in laboratory), spatial and temporal coverage.

It is necessary to collect all available information regarding data, methods and tools in order to evaluate reliability of data for any possible purpose; Task 3: data exploitation a first exploitation of data is accomplished through the upload of data into GET-IT (Geoinformation Enable Toolkit StarterkIT [17]), an interoperable suite software for enabling researchers to share data and metadata in a SDI (Spatial Data Infrastructure). GET-IT allows the management, sharing and visualization of observational data; Task 4: sharing and dissemination in coherence with the Open Science framing, it is fundamental to plan sharing moments, intended here not only as publication of research inputs and outputs, but also the dissemination of new concepts and methods (e.g. by participating in meetings and conference) and the promotion of exchanges with other researchers, potentially interested into the same topic, which could pick new ideas for their work and, conversely, improve EcoNAOS project; Task 5: data citation since our database is dynamic (e.g new observations are added by different people), data citation can not be intended in a traditional way. Anyway we could perform queries on data and cite only a portion of the database.

Probably due to some errors in transcribing old data from on board journals to spreadsheet and to some inconsistencies in the name of sampling stations, the database was quite heterogeneous. First of all, the names of the stations were homogenized maintaining the most recently used station codes. Then we corrected the position of the points wrongly located on land into their right position at sea by matching the sample station names. These procedures have been executed in GRASS GIS [13] and vector layers of sampling stations and 3D layer of observations have been produced.

With a database covering a 50 years period, methods and instruments changed over time, in terms of unit of measures, standard errors associated to observations and so on, which could lead to database inconsistency when treated as a unique element. With the aim to prevent this data inconsistency, we collected all possible metadata associated to instruments and data. We started from the historical cruises examining instruments on board of research vessels: we produced some technical reports [14] listing all the instruments, units of measures and other elements qualifying data reliability in relation to the period/method of the observation. We then examined the whole database including more recent data and, for each parameter, we listed the instruments/methods used in time. All this information is stored into the database and associated to each single observation. However, no parameter values were manipulated and recalculated due to changes in the unit of measure, in order to preserve original data following the principle to \"Keep raw data raw\" suggested in best practices works [15,16].
