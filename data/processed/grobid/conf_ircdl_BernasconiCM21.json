Efforts of transitioning to electronic documents (either created natively as such or digitized) have helped, enabling the direct text-based search of the content.

Nonetheless, the evaluation of the quality of the entity extraction (Section 5.1) highlighted some issues that need to be addressed in future versions and considered in related works, like the wrong resolution of acronyms and abbreviations and the incorrect disambiguation of entities due to the absence of the correct entity in the DBpedia KG.","refs":[]},{"text":"Another feedback is that some users complained about a relatively small amount of information in the internal KG (built with the concepts of 112 books and the related metadata).

Through a knowledge graph-based navigation, users can start from any relevant entity and reach other entities related to it, discovering in which books or articles each entity is present and evaluating which of these results are useful for their research. The user studies conducted so far confirm the amenability of the proposed system to domain experts who were able to perform non-trivial tasks of search and exploration, tasks that would be more cumbersome to execute with the search tools they are used to. Feedback gathered from users suggest that the proposed exploration mechanism tends to amplify the user experience by also offering opportunities for further study and discovery of sources, themes, and materials, which have the potential of enriching the research process with new ideas.","refs":[]},{"text":"Through the presented user study, many desiderata have been collected, and they can be used to guide further development and experimentation in this context. Furthermore, in order to extend the evaluation to more users, a more extensive indirect observation study has been planned. In addition to the questionnaire, the analysis will be further completed with objective data gathered by tracking users' activity through interaction logs.","refs":[]},{"text":"As a potential future direction of research and development, the scope of the semantic enrichment process could be broadened to other document elements, such as images and captions, enriching KG exploration.","refs":[]}]}],"tables":{},"abstract":{"title":"Abstract","paragraphs":[{"text":"Semantic enrichment methods may be used to identify relevant entities in textual documents. These extracted entities are part of knowledge graphs and thus linked by semantic relationships. This work explores the idea of navigating the semantic relationships among extracted entities as a way to search a text corpus. A modular software system (including document management, semantic enrichment, data consolidation, and data integration) has been designed, to offer a visual user interface for such navigation on top of an arbitrary corpus of textual documents. The software, called arca, has been used in a real use case: to search in the book catalogue of a publishing house. The evaluation carried out with a set of potential users has shown so far the feasibility and effectiveness of the approach. Critical issues and potential limitations of the paradigm have also been found and are discussed.","refs":[]}]}}
