A more accurate investigation, done by checking the Web pages of some well-known museums in the world, shows that all of them have at least one active art temporary exhibition at any time during the year.

The latter should give organizers a clear overview of the level of success of the exhibition and of the reasons for that outcome.

Here the main goal is to understand opinions, sentiments and attitudes concerning different topics, as expressed in the text. One typical application scenario concerns enterprises that can discover opinioned information and detect the sentiment polarity of their customers about their products or their competitors [18]. Twitter represents a novel and very challenging domain for sentiment analysis and opinion mining [9][10][11]. Tweet length and textual informalities are the main issues that must be faced in this context. The majority of the proposed approaches applies machine-learning approaches to message contents and/or tags (e.g. [2,12]) while the remaining approaches are mainly lexicon-based (e.g. [13]). The other stream of research concerns social network analysis. Most of the research in this context is focused on the identification of social influencers [4,17,21] and their role in diffusing information [3].

Some papers already investigate this phenomena, mainly concentrating on the evaluation aspect. [16] proposes a social-based solution for a fast and effective gathering of feedbacks from museum visitors. The idea is to engage online users as contributors through a mobile application that allows visitors to post their ideas, feelings, and feedbacks on Twitter and Facebook at any time in the exhibition. [5] introduces a set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for quantitative estimation of Cultural Heritage Sensitivity as expressed by social network users. The approach is data driven: it analyzes terms and concepts belonging to Twitter users' messages and compares them to concepts from domain specific and general ontologies, such an analysis is then integrated with geo-referencing and temporal analysis. [6] provides a quantitative and qualitative study of the messages sent on Twitter during the MuseumWeek event. \"MuseumWeek\" is a communication event that was designed and planned by Twitter in 2014 together with various European museums to improve their visibility. The organization principle was simple: each day was dedicated to a theme, with specific hashtag, and users were encouraged to use the hashtag of the day as well as the generic hashtag #MuseumWeek. The outcomes show that the main goals of this promotional event were achieved. [14] studies how the relation between archives, museums and users is changed thanks to the large diffusion of social networks. The analysis is based on case studies of Danish archives and museums using Instagram for digital curating, outreach and communication.

Whenever an hashtag is not reported, this means that we did not find one2 ; if an hashtag is reported but the first two check boxes are not checked, this means that we found an hashtag that is actually used in tweets but it is not clear who created it (users or organizers).

To understand if there are characteristics that affect the spread of a tweet, we analyze the presence of three information within a tweet: sentiment, spam and link. Results are shown in Fig. 6. Note that, sentiment is computed using the AFINN python library and messages are considered as spam when more than 4 hashtags or more than 1 link or more than 3 mentions are present in a tweet [17].","refs":[{"start":225,"end":226,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_6"},{"start":421,"end":425,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b16"}]},{"text":"@VanGoghDetails posts neutral tweets, 97% of the followers reached by #beyondCaravaggio tweets are due to 55% of positive tweets; 11% of the followers reached by #OrlandoFurioso tweets are due to the 5% of positive tweets. @VanGoghDetails posts tweets without spam; 100% of the followers reached by #beyondCaravaggio and by #OrlandoFurioso tweets are due to tweets without spam; 11% of the followers reached by #OrlandoFurioso tweets are due to the 5% of positive tweets. @VanGoghDetails posts tweets with a link to Van Gogh painting; 94% of the followers reached by #beyondCaravaggio tweets are due to tweets with a link (79%); 90% of the followers reached by #OrlandoFurioso tweets are due to the tweets with a link (84%).","refs":[]}]},{"title":"Findings and Guidelines","paragraphs":[{"text":"The dataset analysis allowed us to outline some guidelines to advertise and stimulate the interest around art exhibitions through the use of hashtag and of Twitter.","refs":[]},{"text":"-Create and divulgate a hashtag, use it every time and on every means (e.g., fliers, websites, newspapers, magazines, playbill, etc.) when advertising the art exhibition. -Post tweets with the official hashtag throughout the day. Indeed, it is important to post contents not only during the opening hours of the exhibition, but also when the exhibition is closed (e.g., at night and during the evening). This allows reaching people with different habits. -Always insert a picture into the tweet, preferably a framework of the exhibition. Data show that these messages are more retweeted and, therefore, they reach more people. -Avoid using multiple hashtags in the message to increase its spread. Multiple hashtags produce negligible positive effects, and greatly reduce the interest around the message and around the accounts who post it. -Avoid retweeting messages that embed the official hashtag. It only confuses followers. People who want to follow the conversation around the official hashtag can do it without any problem and without the official account to retweet it.","refs":[]},{"text":"-Be focused on the exhibition contents, thus avoid posting mere courtesy messages like \"Thank @user for visiting us\" or \"Welcome @user to our exhibition\".

We observed very different behaviors: those who do not consider hashtags at all in the means used to promote the exhibition (e.g., fliers, playbill, webpages, etc.); those who create official hashtags, but hardly mention it; those who create multiple hashtag for the same exhibition; those who create an official hashtag, but hardly use it; those who create an official hashtag, but are very confused about their usage. We analyzed the tweets posted with hashtags related to famous painters and with official hashtags of art exhibitions. We observed that a smart usage of hashtags might stimulate the interest around art. Indeed, we highlighted positive aspects and behaviors to avoid and we outlined few practical guidelines that might help in better use of hashtags while promoting art exhibitions. Finally, we observe that a good use of hashtags and Twitter resolves in the creation of a large corpus of tweets that can be used to evaluate the art exhibition in terms of measuring the visitors feelings and their geographical origins, their opinions, their involvement and engagement and many other useful information that might be helpful to propose and promote future art exhibitions.","refs":[]}]}],"tables":{"tab_0":{"heading":"Table 1 .","description":"Investigation of the use of hashtags in current temporary exhibitions (on December 2016).","rows":[["Museum","Exhibition","Exhibition hashtag","# on Web Site? #"],["","","","on Twitter?
