Over the last two decades, many document dewarping techniques have been proposed. The main issue of those proposals is that they are specifically designed for typewritten text, so, they produce low quality results when applied to handwritten texts or hybrid documents (documents that contain a mix of typewritten and handwritten text). Generally, we can divide these approaches in two categories according to the surface model adopted: restoration approaches based on 3D document shape reconstruction [4,7] and restoration approaches based on 2D document image processing [8,20]. The 3D reconstruction models are more accurate but they require images captured with special setup to properly work and this is not the case of common historical digital documents. The 2D approaches, instead, make use of the information contained in the document image in order to restore the page, so they are much more suitable for historical documents. An interesting technique belonging to the second group has been proposed by Stamatopoulos et al. in [16]: a two-step approach for efficient dewarping. At the first step, a coarse dewarping is completed with the help of a transformation model, in which a curved surface is projected in a 2D rectangular area. At the second step, fine dewarping is conducted thanks to the word detection, since all words poses are normalized based on the lower and upper word baselines. In [2] a novel approach based on [16] for performing dewarping on Italian historical document images, containing both typewritten and handwritten texts, is presented. This represents the baseline of the XDOCS project so it is described in details in Sect. 3.1.","refs":[{"start":517,"end":520,"marker":"bibr","target":null},{"start":520,"end":522,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b6"},{"start":588,"end":591,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b7"},{"start":591,"end":594,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b19"},{"start":1028,"end":1056,"marker":"bibr","target":null},{"start":1453,"end":1457,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b15"}]}]},{"title":"Word Spotting.","paragraphs":[{"text":"In [11,12], the original idea of word spotting for handwritten manuscripts was proposed.

Tomai et al. [19] proposed a word-by-word mapping between a scanned document and a manual transcript: in this way, it is possible to perform word location in document pages. This method relies on a Optical Character Recognizer (OCR) used as a recognizer for multiple word segmentation hypothesis generated for each line of the document. Results shown that a OCR is not a feasible solution and useful for handwritten historical manuscript recognition. In [15] a local descriptor inspired by a famous key-point descriptor, SIFT [10], is proposed. Here, two different word spotting systems, based on the well-known Hidden Markov Models and Dinamic Time Warping (DTW), are exploited to achieve significant improvements. In [14] a range of features suitable for DTW has been analyzed. In that paper, different text features, which are extracted from pre-processed rectangular word images and that do not contain ascenders from other words, are used to achieve speed and precision. Exploited features are the gray scale variance, the projection profile, background to ink transitions, the partial projection profile, the upper and lower word profile, and feature sets containing vertical and horizontal partial derivatives.
