On the basis of this idea, the development of the SACHER user interface exploits the 3D model and integrate three different design layers:","refs":[]},{"text":"-the workflow of model of interaction between the users and the system; -the organisation of the space of the interface with respect to the different tasks the users can perform; -the graphics style of the interface.","refs":[]},{"text":"In the SACHER platform, navigation is marked by three interfaces, with three different levels of access and hierarchy (Fig. 3):","refs":[{"start":124,"end":125,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_2"}]},{"text":"-UI for introduction and presentation; -UI for Cultural Heritage catalogue search; -UI for information retrieval and data entry.","refs":[]},{"text":"The first user interface (Fig. 4) is accessible to any user, and has the function of presenting and providing general information about the SACHER project, its partners' contacts, and a slideshow. The slideshow plays a relevant role in the platform, since it showcases the most important projects managed by SACHER, and it promotes the companies and professionals who work there.   Through this page, access is granted to the Cultural Heritage catalogue search interface (Fig. 5), where the SACHER Cultural Heritage catalogue can be explored through the search field or through navigation on an interactive map.","refs":[{"start":31,"end":32,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_3"},{"start":477,"end":478,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_4"}]},{"text":"If the user level allows it, new Cultural Heritage items can also be registered.

Data can be consulted by navigating the 3D model, and isolating the single elements of interest.","refs":[]},{"text":"If the user level allows it, it is possible to enter new data, indicating the relevant position on the 3D model, and attaching pictures or other documents. The windows that allow these operations are designed to save time, and to prevent users from becoming disoriented during interactions with the 3D model. The graphic style of the interface is inspired by the \"Material Design\" guidelines developed by Google, to improve usage and effectiveness of the digital tools, and to ensure compatibility on whichever device is used to access the platform. The colours are part of the coordinated image of SACHER, and due care has been used to avoid altering the perception of the 3D textures.","refs":[]}]},{"title":"System Prototype","paragraphs":[{"text":"As previously suggested by Cucchiara et al. [10], the goal of this system is to bridge the gap between two different worlds, multimedia technologies and the arts, which can benefit from each other contributions.

The main reason is to avoid vendor lock-in and to create a system that is completely independent from proprietary tools and formats and that can be easily adopted by anyone. A secondary but still very important aspect to consider is the cost reduction due to lack of software licenses needed to run open-source software.","refs":[]},{"text":"We propose an architecture based on a web platform, which is easily accessible and does not require the users to install any kind of technical 3D modeling software to visualize the models.","refs":[]},{"text":"The prototype of the system is based on a web platform called \"eXo Platform\", which is an open-source social collaboration software aimed at the creation of corporate intranets.

The platform is able to run on Tomcat or JBoss, two well known web application servers. The platform data is managed through the Java JCR API (Java Content Repository), an API that allows access to data repositories in a uniform manner, hiding the actual storage strategy. eXo Platform requires a database in order to work properly but is not tied to a specific RDBMS, in its default configuration it uses HSQLDB, a DBMS engine written in Java that is also able to use the filesystem to store the data and does not require a server application.","refs":[]},{"text":"The strength of the eXo platform lies in its customization capabilities and in this project the platform has been widely customized to be able to host all the data needed to manage many Cultural Heritage restoration projects. By default, the website is accessible only to registered users, so a public homepage with \"Login\" and \"Register\" buttons has been added, in order to allow new users to request access to the platform. By logging in a user is able to browse the social area of the platform which shows the latest activities from the user's connections in a dashboard, as shown in Fig. 7.","refs":[{"start":592,"end":593,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_6"}]},{"text":"The most interesting and useful feature offered by the eXo platform is called \"Spaces\". A space is a private area of the website in which subscribed users are able to share documents, wikis, forums and calendar events. In this project the concept of a space has been used to create private areas dedicated to different restoration projects, each of them with its own models and documents, such as images, technical reports and analysis, etc. In Fig. 8 the private document area reserved for a space is shown. The documents uploaded in this section are not available to those users who are not part of the space.  The main custom feature added to the platform concerns the 3D models visualization. Since the eXo platform provides an extensible mechanism to display specific file types in the browser, such an extension has been created based on a visualizer called 3DHOP (3D Heritage Online Presenter) [17]. 3DHOP is an open-source 3D model visualizer created by CNR (Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche) specifically designed to show Cultural Heritage 3D models in a web browser.

In Fig. 9 is shown an example of an editing popup. Each spot is associated with a folder in the space's private documents area in which all the files associated with the spot can be stored. The folder is accessible directly from the spot's editing popup by clicking on a link, an example of such a folder is shown in Fig. 10. The annotation feature is possible by means of a REST service integrated with the eXo platform which manages all the annotations stored in the JCR database and provides a special download method that supports the HTTP \"range\" parameter. The REST service is also accessible from other clients, not only by the eXo platform users, making the annotations' data also available to other applications.","refs":[{"start":412,"end":413,"marker":"figure","target":null},{"start":726,"end":728,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_0"}]},{"text":"This platform has been tested on a dedicated server with a 6-core CPU, 16 GB RAM and 150 GB of storage running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.","refs":[]}]},{"title":"Conclusions","paragraphs":[{"text":"In this paper we presented a brief overview of the existing systems for Cultural Heritage management, then illustrating the SACHER project, a platform designed to better manage CH restoration processes.

The SACHER project intends to fill this gap, working both on a technological level and on a business model level: firstly providing a platform based on an open-source distributed cloud-computing environment for the management of the complete data lifecycle related to cultural assets; moreover providing new models based on participatory design for Cultural Heritage data directed towards social entrepreneurship. This paper presents the first implementation of a system for managing data based on the 3D model of the cultural object, with a focus on the process for cultural assets management and the interface design for cultural services.","refs":[]}]}}
