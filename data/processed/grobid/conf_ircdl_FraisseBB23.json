As a gateway to knowledge and culture, the field of LIS holds a long history on collecting, storing, organizing, and sharing access to knowledge. To this purpose, Knowledge Organization Systems (KOS), Information Retrieval Systems (IRS) and metadata exchange standards, among others, have been developed to meet the opportunities arising through the development of new technologies. Collections of the world's great libraries have been made available to the public through large-scale digitization. The Online Computer Library Center (OCLC) dedicated to the public purposes of furthering access to the world's information produces and maintains WorldCat [2], the largest Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC) in the world. WorldCat itemizes the collections of 72,000 libraries in 170 countries and territories. Multilingual online digital libraries and archival projects collect documents and make them available to a wide audience: the Wikisource project (https://wikisource.org), an online digital library of free content textual sources, the Internet Archive project (https://archive.org) building a digital library of Internet sites and other cultural artifacts in digital form such as books and audio records, or the Gutenberg project (https://www.gutenberg.org) offering over 56,000 free written and audio eBooks and especially older works for which copyright has expired in more than 50 under-resourced languages.

He wrote numerous essays on how to collect and organize the world's knowledge [1,3]. The ever growing number of digital documents and scientific and political interests in making them openly available all over the world has led to the creation of new digital collections in a broad range of fields and languages. Several Registries of Open Access Repositories (ROARs) hosted by national and international organizations and universities, have been developed. For example, The Library of Congress has digitized approximately 164 million items in virtually all formats, languages, subjects, and periods. These collections are broad in scope, including research materials in more than 470 languages and multiple media. The Europeana collection, launched in 2008 and funded by the European Commission, contains over fifteen million digitized paintings, drawings, maps, photos, books, newspapers, letters, diaries, etc., from fifteen hundred institutions. However, the language barrier is a key issue that Knowledge Organization Systems (KOS) have to address as described in [4,5,6]. Indeed, over time, the gap between languages of dominant nations or civilizations and other languages has been growing.

The twentieth-century folklorist Alan Lomax devoted his life to recording, celebrating, and promo-ting folk artists and tradition bearers in America, the Caribbean, and Europe. He conducted extensive fieldwork trips during which he produced audio recordings and extensive notes about the people he met, and their traditional arts. His goal was to demonstrate the value of traditional arts, and challenge what he saw as a hegemonic media and cultural system in America and Europe which failed to make room for cultural differences and killed off diversity. As argued in [13], Lomax was critical of \"a centralized mediascape through which was broadcast an industrial American mono-culture\". \"Too few transmitters and too many receivers\" was his central complaint. He was frustrated with the myopic unilateralism of corporate programming, which he saw operating through an \"over-powerful, over-rich, over-reaching\" communication system. His answer to this was what he termed \"cultural equity\": the right for folk communities-what he called \"little bubbles of song and delight and ways of life and cookery, \" encompassing \"hundreds of thousands of these little generators of the original\" -to have their voices heard and their traditions represented. \" Lomax ultimately re-corded over 1000 cultural groups, and hundreds of under-represented languages. He established the Association for Cultural Equity to advocate for folk artists, and dona-ted his field notebooks, recordings, letters, and other papers to the Library of Congress where he helped to establish the American Folklife Center (AFC). In 2015, the AFC digitized Lomax's papers and made them available online. In 2019, AFC partnered with a new crowdsourcing effort called By the People at the Library of Congress, to crowdsource the transcription, review, and tagging of these papers. By the People's goals are to engage a diverse volunteer base with cultural heritage preserved at the Library of Congress; to generate transcriptions that will improve online search at the document level, and to provide transcriptions that can be read by screen readers, in order to assist people with visual or cognitive impairments, and those who can't read original handwriting. By the People launched in October 2018 and to date volunteers have transcribed over 100,000 pages from a variety of collections including the papers of Rosa Parks, Walt Whitman, President Abraham Lincoln, and leading suffragists such as Susan B. Anthony and Mary Church Terrell. Volunteers are encouraged through the site itself, emails, in-person events, and social media to explore the documents, ask questions, speak with one another, and Library employees about their findings, struggles, and what they're learning. Their knowledge is taken back into the Library website in the form of transcriptions and enhanced metadata. By the People is a natural extension of Alan Lomax's efforts to build \"'two-way bridges' and 'two-way inter-communication systems' for traditions presented in any medium\" as described in [14]. Documents in \"The Man Who Recorded the World: On the Road with Alan Lomax\" By the People transcription Campaign include materials in Haitian Creole, and dialects of Swedish, Polish, Danish, Hungarian, and other languages spoken by nineteenthand twentieth-century migrants to the American Midwest, which volunteers transcribe in the original language. In addition to reaching out to over 30,000 registered volunteers to encourage them to participate in the project, AFC folklorists reached out to several descendants of the tradition bearers whom Lomax originally recorded to encourage them to contribute to By the People, and bring their knowledge to bear in this next phase of folklife preservation and exploration.","refs":[{"start":725,"end":729,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b12"},{"start":3194,"end":3198,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b13"}]}]},{"title":"The FromThePage platform as a gateway to our cultural heritage","paragraphs":[{"text":"FromThePage is a collaborative textual editing platform released under an open-source license.

Unlike the existing curation model where knowledge is collected only by professional librarians or researchers, we extended the proposed data curation model proposed in [17] to the the collection and the incremental enrichment of multilingual bibliographic records. We conducted a first experiment of this model on Mark Twain texts [18]. Mark Twain's books are some of the most well-travelled texts on the planet.

His works have been translated into many languages [19] including under-resourced languages. The novel Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is one of the most commonly translated of his books. Due to the significant number of existing translations and the growing number of digital versions made available online, the crowdsourcing allowed us [17] to gather data that would have otherwise been beyond our reach [20]. Crowdsourcing helped reduce the amount of time spent on the task, increase the variety and the range of the data covered (such as identifying translations which are not indexed in public databases). The parameterization of the crowdsourcing experiment was as follows: as we are looking for translations over the world, we have not limited the geographic location of the contributors. Each task consisted of a set of nine questions (i.e., units in the crowdsourcing terminology). First, we asked people to use search engines or online catalogs to look for existing translations in their native language. Then, we asked them if they could find the translator's name, the first year of publication, the publishing house, the URL of the cover, the bibliographic record if it is available, the list of subjects that could be used to index the translation, and available public digital versions.","refs":[{"start":407,"end":411,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b16"},{"start":570,"end":574,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b17"},{"start":695,"end":696,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_1"},{"start":841,"end":845,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b18"},{"start":1127,"end":1131,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b16"},{"start":1195,"end":1199,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b19"}]}]},{"title":"Interactive and incremental deep mapping of multilingual bibliographic records","paragraphs":[{"text":"Unlike existing knowledge sharing models used by most digital libraries and collections, we propose a new interactive model allowing end-users and volunteer scholars to search, contribute and share their knowledge about an original work through an interactive and online global knowledge map (Figure 1) called Deep Maps in [21].
