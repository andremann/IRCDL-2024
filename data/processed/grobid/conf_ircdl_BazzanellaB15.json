One of the first studies on this topic, named DIGOIDUNA [5], was conducted on behalf of the EC in 2011. The study has investigated the fundamental role of digital identifiers as enablers of value in e-science infrastructures and has performed a detailed analysis of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the current digital identifier landscape in order to identify the main challenges and propose a set of recommendations which policy makers and relevant stakeholders should address to develop an open and sustainable persistent identifier infrastructure supporting information access and preservation. One of the main conclusions of the study is that to transform digital identifiers from simple means to manage data to keys for delivering value to the stakeholders within the research production, it is necessary to foster the development of an interoperable, cross-domain infrastructure for persistent identifiers supporting data access and sharing across national, organizational, disciplinary and technological boundaries. The implementation of this infrastructure poses not only technical challenges but raises a multidimensional spectrum of organizational, social and economical issues which should be addressed to ensure a coordinated ecosystem. A recent effort in investigating this multifaceted set of issues with the purpose of harmonizing the current identifiers solutions has been made within two working groups of the Research Data Alliance (RDA), an international forum focused on solutions for enabling open sharing of data. The RDA PID Interest Group3 aims to bring together relevant stakeholders and practitioners to define emerging PID use cases in the domain of data and coordinate the use of persistent identifiers for supporting referencing and citation of research products and authors, and manage the lifecycle of research data production.

The first prototype of this system has emerged as a solution for the entity identification problem in the Semantic Web [6], that is the problem of integrating information about entities which are assigned multiple identifiers (i.e. URIs) in different systems or by different users [7]. Recently, the scope of the system has been extended to address the problem of the proliferation of identifiers (i.e. PIs) in other distributed management information contexts like libraries, archives, publisher systems and e-science infrastructures, evolving into a bridge infrastructure for Web identifiers and PIs. The first aim of the ENS is to provide a service to assign globally unique identifiers to entities named in information sources and reuse these identifiers across systems boundaries regardless of the place or domain where they have been first assigned. To this purpose, the ENS has a scalable repository 13 for storing entity identifiers along with a short set of descriptive metadata, i.e. an entity profile, which is used to disambiguate each entity from the others. When a human user or an application inquire the system for an identifier (for example by keywords through the Web search interface14 ), the information of the entity profiles is used to establish (through advanced entity matching algorithms) if an identifier has been already assigned and stored for that entity. Otherwise, a new identifier is minted and returned by the system. The systematic reuse of the identifiers created and maintained in the ENS is aimed at reducing the multiplication of identifiers for entities and enabling a straightforward solution for entity-centric integration of information spread across different systems and platforms. However, since the convergence of different users on the use of a unique identification standard is desirable but very hard to be realized at a global level, the coordination and interoperability of different identifier systems has emerged as the second main function implemented in the ENS. Therefore, the ENS implements a service to store (within the entity profiles) and manage equivalent identifiers (i.e. alternative IDs) assigned to the same entities by different systems. This service, called Mapping service, together with the other services described in Table 1 support the core operation of the ENS. Local private nodes (replicas) of the infrastructure can be implemented to include the same core services with the aim of managing entities or sensitive information which need to be maintained physically separated from the rest of the public infrastructure. Today, more than 9 millions of entities are managed by the system and the number is growing every day. In the next section we will discuss how on top of this core infrastructure, the ENS has been evolved into an interoperability infrastructure bridging digital identifiers in use in e-science and other digital contexts.

The simple change consists of the separation of the ENS-ID (e.g. ens:eid-a5afe3ae-071f-4ec3-b904-3481aa5a6a05) from the resolver (http://www. okkam.org). This introduces a level of indirection between the identifier and its referent, decoupling persistent identification from resolution and retrieval. When the ENS-ID is combined with the ENS default resolver, its resolution returns a small set of metadata (included in the ENS entity profile) related to the identified entity. The real potential of separating the token ID from the resolver rests on the possibility of associating the same ID to multiple resolvers, enabling a mechanism of multiple resolution and distribution of authority in the management of data. Different actors can create or reuse Persistent ENS-IDs for entities of interest using the ENS and through their local resolvers or domain names enable precise (and possibly long-term) access to information they want to provide. In this way, ID management and default resolution are addressed by the ENS, whereas information management, including persistence of content and reliable resolution, is managed by content providers. The ENS-IDs can be used to create Cool URIs (through the web resolution protocol and the DNS) allowing Linked Data users to create URIs resolvable to any information source they like. At the same time, persistent identifiers users can reuse the same IDs to identify information objects and resources managed by trusted institutions which ensure their persistent access and association to a physical location. This improvement of the ENS may offer a co-ordinated solution to identifier issues across the PI and the Linked Data communities, enabling data creators and curators to combine the technical strengths and opportunities of the (Semantic) Web vision with the organizational, economical and social requirements legitimately raised by PI stakeholders with the result of opening new forms of interactions between open structured data published on the Web and content stored and preserved by more traditional cultural heritage institutions.","refs":[{"start":38,"end":41,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b3"}]},{"text":"The Co-reference Level: At this level the EIB implements a small set of core interoperability services on top of the Mapping Service of the ENS to enable access and reuse of mappings between alternative identifiers for the same entity.

For example, the user can enter the Cool URI of a resource (as shown in Fig. 2) and access to the resource (or a description of it) through the resolver of a selected alternative ID.

At the third level, identifiers are linked across metadata/vocabularies. Different persistent IDs are usually associated to different metadata models. If a mapping among them is available, the information represented according to a data model in one source can be translated into a different model and re-used to integrate or update the information of another source adopting that model. Therefore, in order to support semantic interoperability across services and communities, the ENS should provide an extensive mapping of vocabularies and schemes adopted in different PID domains. In addition, since these mappings can be also defined contextually and different users can have their own mappings for the same vocabularies, a solution for managing these mappings and making them reusable, should be the result of a large-scale social process where users can create their mappings but also reuse the mappings defined by other users. Following this idea, a Web service, called OKKAM Synapsis 15 , has been developed to store and maintain user-defined mappings between terms in controlled vocabularies, models and ontologies. Through the application, a user (human user or API user) can search the available mappings for the classes and properties of the models present in the system, add new mappings, rate (like it) and edit existing mappings (e.g. tagging, adding a description). In addition, the user can upload a new model (i.e. the target ontology) and define his/her own mappings for the model. The mappings are defined by specifying the Resource URI, that is the URI of the resource mapped towards the element of the target ontology and the type of relation between them 16 . The service allows to filter the stored mappings by author, tags, status and type of relation. While in the APARSEN Interoperability Framework semantic interoperability is addressed by proposing a common ontology which should be used by content providers to expose their data in a common way, the ENS approach focuses on the alignment of different vocabularies through ontology mapping. This has the advantage that users can maintain their own vocabularies and ontologies, without the need of restructuring their content according to a new model. The mapping of vocabularies allows to support the building of crosswalks between them and can be extended to include an indefinite number of vocabularies (Fig. 3).","refs":[{"start":2410,"end":2411,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_2"}]}]},{"title":"Conclusion","paragraphs":[{"text":"In this paper, we propose an open scalable interoperability infrastructure (EIB) for persistent identifiers and other digital identifiers in e-science.
