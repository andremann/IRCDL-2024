Guaranteeing an easy and ample dissemination of some of the fundamental moments of the musical culture of our times is an act of democracy which cannot be renounced and which must be assured to future generations, even through the creation of new instruments for the acquisition, preservation and transmission of information. This is a crucial point, which is nowadays the core of reflection of the international archive community. If, on the one hand, scholars and the general public have begun paying greater attention to the recordings of artistic events, on the other hand, the systematic preservation and access to these documents is complicated by their diversified nature and amount.","refs":[]},{"text":"Within the group of documents commonly labeled audio analogue the sound recordings on discs are the most spread in the world from 1898 until about 1990. The common factor with this group of documents is the method of recording the information. This is by means of a groove cut into the surface by a cutting stylus and which is modulated by the sounds, either directly in the case of acoustic recordings (shellac 78 rpm discs) or by electronic amplifiers (shellac 78 rpm or vinyl discs). The wide time span in which these formats (with: different speed, number of audio channels, carrier chemistry characteristics) have been developed makes it even harder to select the correct playing format for each carrier. It should be clear the importance of transfer into the digital domain (active preservation), namely for carriers in risk of disappearing, respecting the indications of the international archive community (see [2,3,1] for some guidelines proposals and [26,5] for the ethics of the audio documents re-recordings). It is well-known that the recording of an event can never be a neutral operation, since the timbre quality and the plastic value of the recorded sound, which are of great importance in contemporary music (electro-acoustic, pop/rock, ethnic music) are already determined by the choice of the number and arrangement of the microphones used during the recording. Moreover, the audio processing carried out by the tonmeister is a real interpretative element added to the recording of the event. Thus, musicological and historic-critical competence becomes essential for the individuation and correct cataloguing of the information contained in audio documents. The commingling of a technical and scientific formation with historic-philological knowledge also becomes essential for preservative rerecording operations, which do not coincide completely with pure A/D transfer, as it is, unfortunately, often thought.","refs":[{"start":919,"end":922,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b1"},{"start":922,"end":924,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b2"},{"start":924,"end":926,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b0"},{"start":961,"end":965,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b25"},{"start":965,"end":967,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b4"}]},{"text":"The increased dimensionality of the data contained within an audio digital library should be dealt with by means of automatic annotation.

It aims to preserve the documentary unity, and its bibliographic equivalent is the facsimile or the diplomatic copy. Signal processing techniques are allowed only when they are finalized to the carrier restoration. Differently by the SchÃ¼ller position, it is our belief that in a preservation copy only the intentional alterations (1) must be compensated (correct equalization of the re-recording system and decoding of any possible intentional signal processing interventions). All the unintentional alterations (also the ones caused by misalignments of the recording equipment) could be compensated only at the access copy level: these imperfections/distortions must be preserved because they witness the history of the audio document transmission. The A/D transfer process should represent the original document characteristics, from either information and material points of view, as it arrived to us. According to the indications of the international archive community [2,3,1,16,15,17]: 1) the recording is transferred from the original carrier; 2) if necessary, the carrier is cleaned and restored so as to repair any climactic degradations which may compromise the quality of the signal; 3) re-recording equipment is chosen among the current professional equipment available in order not to introduce further distortions; 4) sampling frequency and bit rate must be chosen with respect to the archival sound record standard (at least, 96 kHz / 24 bit, adopting the guideline: the worse the signal, the higher the resolution); 5) the digital audio file format should support high resolution, it should be transparent with simple coding schemes, without data reduction. It is important to highlight that this protocol fits very well in the ontology approach used in [21,22] developed in the field of digital object preservation describing its internal relationships to support the preservation process.

A laser turntable is a phonograph that plays gramophone records using a laser device as the pickup, rather than a conventional diamond tipped stylus [18]. This playback system has the advantage of never physically touching the disc during playback. The laser pickup uses five beams one on each channel to track the sides of the groove, one on each channel to pick up the sound (just below the tracking beams), and a fifth to track the surface of the record and keep the pickup at a constant height, which compensates for record thickness and any warping. The lasers focus on a section of the groove above the level where a conventional stylus will have traveled, and below the typical depth of surface scratches, giving the possibility of like-new reproduction even from worn or scratched records. Using a laser pickup reduces many problems associated with physical styli: horizontal tracking angle error, leveling adjustment issues, channel-balance error, stereo crosstalk, anti-skating compensation, acoustic feedback, problems tracking warped, and cartridge hum pickup. Unfortunately, the laser turntable is, however, extraordinarily sensitive to record cleanliness. Moreover, when a phonographic disc is inserted into the tray drawer and the drawer closed, the turntable reads the surface of the disc, displaying the number of tracks: the record must be black or opaque-colored; transparent or translucent records may not play at all. The laser turntables are constrained to the reflected laser spot only and are susceptible to damage and debris and very sensitive to surface reflectivity.

Nowadays, automatic text scanning and optical character recognition are in wide use at major libraries: unlike texts, A/D transfer of historical sound recordings is often an invasive process.

The images can be processed to extract the audio data. Such an approach offers a way to provide non-contact reconstruction and may in principle sample any region of the groove, also in the case of a broken disc. These scanning methods may form the basis of a strategy for: a) larger scale A/D transfer of mechanical recordings which retains maximal information (2D or 3D model of the grooves) about the native carrier; b) small scale A/D transfer processes, where there are insufficient resources (trained personnel and/or high-end equipments) for a traditional A/D transfer by means of turntables and A/D converters; c) the active preservation of carriers with heavy degradation (breakage, flaking, exudation).

After choosing how to describe the digital recordings, a suitable distance function has to be chosen. We propose to use the cosine of the angle between the vectors representing the amplitude of the Fourier transform, which can be considered a measure of the correlation between the two spectra. Thus, given two recordings f and g, the local distance d(m, n) between two frames can be computed according to equation","refs":[]},{"text":"where F m (G n ) is the magnitude spectrum of frame m(n) of recording f (g), while in our application K = 8192 points. Local distance can be represented by a distance matrix, as shown in Fig. 2, where the main similarities are along the diagonal with large dark squares correspond to long sustained notes and brighter areas represent a low degree of similarity between two frames. In order to reduce computational cost, the local distance needs to be computed only in proximity of the diagonal. After the local distance matrix is computed, DTW finds the best aligning path computing the cumulative distance c(m, n) between the two recordings. We chose to force the global alignment to involve all the frames of both signals, so that for each frame in one of the recordings there is at least one corresponding frame in the second. In this way it is possible to compare the acoustic characteristics of any couple of recordings, for instance assessing how different analogue equipments are to a particular damage, highlighting its effect in the frequency representation.","refs":[{"start":192,"end":193,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_1"}]}]},{"title":"Case Studies","paragraphs":[{"text":"As case studies we selected two shellac discs, which :","refs":[]},{"text":"-Pasquale Abete, Fronne 'e limone (the term \"fronne 'e limone\" represents a popular music genre from Southern Italy), recorded in New York in May 1921, thus it is a mechanical recording and it has been played at 80 rpm. -Leonardo Dia, La signorina sfinciusa (The funny girl), recorded in New York on the 24th July 1929, in this case, because it was an American electric recording it has been played at 78.26 rpm.","refs":[]},{"text":"The audio signal was extracted in four ways:  original signal and to the artifacts (scratch and dust) on the carrier, the four systems give comparable results.

Although there are some differences on the sensitiveness in respect to either the audio signal and to the corruptions, the four approaches give comparable results. The choice of the system depends on the aims of the audio archive, as described in Sect. 2, but is also biased by the resources (human and economical) that are available for the A/D transfer task. The results of this study suggest different directions. A federation of libraries may have a number of different digital versions of the same material, and metadata may describe neither the A/D transfer nor the link to the original carrier.
