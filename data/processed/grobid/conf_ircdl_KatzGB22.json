This compilation was not awarded the intensive study and commentary of its Babylonian counterpart (Talmud Bavli), and the text we have today is full of scribal errors and omissions.","refs":[]},{"text":"Since the Jerusalem Talmud was not nearly as popular as the Babylonian Talmud, there are relatively few textual witnesses of this work. The majority of the text is reflected in a single manuscript -the famous MS Leiden. This manuscript was written in Italy 1289, and is the basis for the Venice print of 1523. Another significant manuscript is the Italian Vatican 133, which contains approximately one quarter of the entire Jerusalem Talmud (order Zeraim and tractate Sotah), and is considered one of the most corrupted manuscripts of Talmudic literature, although it does contain many authentic readings. Other manuscripts include significantly smaller portions of the Talmud: The Spanish MS Escorial of tractate Neziqin; a few manuscripts (and an early print) of tractate Sheqalim, and various fragments from the Cairo Genizah and the European Genizah, which were used as book bindings for European manuscripts. In 2012, Y. Sussmann published his Thesaurus of Talmudic Manuscripts, which cataloged, inter alia, all known manuscripts of the Jerusalem Talmud at the time. Additions to the catalog were made by the FJMS team, and in 2020, Sussmann published a new comprehensive edition of all known Genizah fragments of the Jerusalem Talmud (Ginze HaYerushalmi; regarding the edition, its importance, and shortcomings, see: Cherlow, 2021).","refs":[]},{"text":"High-resolution images of the Leiden and Vatican manuscripts are available on the library websites, and high-resolution images (along with transliteration) of the Cairo Genizah fragments are available on the Cairo Genizah Project, under the FJMS Portal.

Moreover, no complete critical edition exists for the majority of the Jerusalem Talmud. The first edition to include all the primary features of a desired critical edition is probably Katz's edition of Yerushalmi Qiddushin (2016), based on the MS Leiden text, including the necessary corrections and synopses of the textual witnesses, as well as parallels and citation apparatuses, and a short commentary on the text.","refs":[]},{"text":"The Jerusalem Talmud Tractate Qiddushin was a printed edition; this fact demanded compromises and difficult choices, which the editor of a digital edition would be spared. For example, the editor of the printed edition had to decide whether to present the edition as a continuous text, or divided into Sugyot (free-standing sections of Talmudic text); the synopsis is in the appendix instead of adjacent to the text; the parallels and citations were printed as abbreviations or as references; images of the manuscripts could not be included; and so on.","refs":[]},{"text":"Our Jerusalem Talmud Digital Critical Edition was created as a response to these needs, and offers an edition that suits the needs of the digital world, without compromising scientific value.","refs":[]}]},{"title":"The Jerusalem Talmud Digital Critical Edition 4.1.

Our first undertaking is tractate Yevamot, a project which received a grant from the Israel Science Foundation (1717/19).

The project includes the texts of all other direct textual witnesses (in tractate Yevamot: fragments from Munich and Darmstadt). The transcriptions were created manually, with the assistance of previous editions of the manuscripts and first prints (notably Sch√§fer-Becker's Synopse zum Talmud Yerushalmi, the Academy of the Hebrew Language edition, and Sussmans' Ginze HaYerushalmi), complete with corrections based on thorough review of high-quality images of the manuscripts. Unfortunately, the ability to use OCR to read Hebrew or Aramaic manuscripts is not yet sufficiently developed. When textual manuscript-based projects such as Stoekl et al.'s Sofer Mahir and Tikoun Sofrim will reach a more mature stage, the extension of the edition to the entire Talmud will be far easier to achieve.","refs":[]},{"text":"Indirect witnesses collected from hundreds of later works are also included in this project.

The editors play an important role in selecting and correcting the text. This edition is the first of its kind on two levels: it is the first critical edition of the Jerusalem Talmud (apart from the Tractate Qiddushin edition, which can be viewed as the first stage of the edition's development), as well as the first full critical digital edition of any Talmudic work.","refs":[]}]},{"title":"The Structure, User Interface, and Functions of the Edition 4.2.1.

This website was designed to help editors create a digital edition which include images and texts: Mahadura offers tools that can help editors transcribe the text and present it alongside the image of the manuscript, creating a link between each word in the image and the transcription. Users can hover the cursor over one word in the image, and the corresponding word in the transcription becomes highlighted, and vice versa. Mahadura is a highly sophisticated tool, but it lacks the crucial features of a classical Rabbinic critical edition, such as apparatuses for parallels, citations, and explanatory notes. For this reason, we decided against using it in the preparation of the new Digital Edition of the Jerusalem Talmud project. Nevertheless, the model of Mahadura will be considered while constructing the image module of the edition, albeit with less complex features. Showing an image side by side with each line of the transcription satisfies the needs of most users, and prevents unnecessary complexity, which is also resource-consuming. Several digital editions may be considered as a model for presenting images alongside a text, such as the Book of Ben Sira digital edition (www.bensira.org).","refs":[]}]},{"title":"The Jerusalem Talmud Digital Critical Edition as a Digital Library","paragraphs":[{"text":"The Jerusalem Talmud Digital Critical Edition was designed and constructed as a critical edition: focusing on one work, and using the human mind to reconstruct its original text.
