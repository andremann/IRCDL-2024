preservation in digital libraries is often addressed mainly by means of reliable storage mechanisms, and long-term accessibility of digital supports, both aimed at ensuring that library's contents will remain sustainable, authentic, accessible, and understandable over time. Data evolution, at the same time, is addressed by means of scalability of the physical system, concerning the modification of the stored information either in data formats or in space needed to archive them. Following this vein, many works in literature consider preservation and evolution issues mainly as technological factors (e.g. [3]). In this paper, we take a wider approach, recognizing also the role of other important aspects outside the technological domain. In particular, we explicitly address the semantic aspects of a (textual) content stored in a digital archive. We agree with Ross in claiming that digital preservation is more than keeping the streams of 1s and 0s used to represent information [20]. Preserving information is about maintaining the semantic meaning of both the digital object and its content, maintaining its provenance and authenticity, retaining its interrelatedness, and securing information concerning the context of its creation and use [21].","refs":[{"start":615,"end":618,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b2"},{"start":992,"end":996,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b20"},{"start":1256,"end":1260,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b21"}]},{"text":"Moreover, a digital library is more than the sole data stored in its archives: it serves as an infrastructure to publish, retrieve, and access information fulfilling the final user needs. The user community can be huge and heterogeneous, thus social aspects can also play a critical role in the evolution of a digital library. For example, content production and exploitation processes involve a wide range of different users. The way users exploit their respective tasks may change over time and with experience, as well as with the upcoming of new information needs. The digital library infrastructure should then be aware of the evolution related to social aspects in order to provide users with the ability to easily update the way information is generated, accessed, aggregated, classified, and delivered. The effort needed to align this infrastructure with the evolution of user requirements is not trivial. New requirements often demand for new functional services which must be integrated into the legacy architecture in order to be effective. Hence, handling evolution aspects at the requirement level has also an important but often not recognized impact of the architectural level.","refs":[]},{"text":"In this work we introduce a characterization of a digital library addressing specifically the evolution of both digital content and related services, taking into account the aforementioned considerations. This characterization integrates three complementary domains: social, technological, and informational. These domains can be incorporated into a conceptual model, as discussed in Section 4. We believe that providing such model facilitates the undertaking of the mentioned aspects. Hence, this formal model takes into account both physical and semantic evolution of the archived content, and the way such information is exploited by final users. In particular, semantic concerns are handled in the model at the architectural level by a specific component, the PIRATES framework, as described in Section 6.1.

Each content in Greenstone can be described using metadata compliant with a standard schema (e.g. Dublin Core2 ), either imported or manually provided by librarians. However, Greenstone does not provide any role for managing the content submission process. Moreover, it does not provide functionalities concerning the evolution management of both contents and collection templates. D-Space [24] is a digital library aimed at providing long-term preservation of heterogeneous contents, by improving some of the limitations affecting Greenstone. Authors usually submit their documents to the system, and define metadata for them. D-Space introduces also a multi-roles approach to content publishing, identifying the following actors: authors and organizations, which provide the contents, librarians, which perform content validation, and users, which are interested in content retrieval.

In this context we also introduce the solution to each issue we are proposing in the new prototype which is under construction. Such solutions are detailed in Section 5. A more exhaustive presentation of the problems with representative examples is provided in [6]. The data evolution problem The first prototype of E-Dvara provides users a flexible way to define and update the metadata associated to each digital archive. In particular, users can define a set of schemata which, associated with a specific archive, supplies the structure adopted for storing documents. However, metadata definition can take place during the whole life-cycle of the digital collection, leading to the problem of correctly handle the evolution of data. Such an approach requires the introduction of methodologies devoted to perform data validation accordingly to the schema evolution. In fact, each schema update should be properly spread to the previously validated archives, in order to automatically adapt the existing content to the new schema without introducing potential inconsistencies between data. Clearly, in order to both handle these issues and grant the preservation of yet existing contents, a set of dedicated tools should be provided. Hence, in the new prototype we are integrating the concept of mutable templates.","refs":[{"start":461,"end":464,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b5"}]},{"text":"To understand what is a mutable template, consider Figure 4 which describes the reference data model included in our conceptual model (a complete description of such model follows in Section 5.1). The main idea is to introduce flexibility by separating the data definition (in level M1) with the description of the corresponding types (in level M2). Furthermore, we would allow more than a single possible map between data definitions and types in order to cope with changes in both data formats and structure (e.g. consider the same set of bibliographical items which can be showed to different users using different formats). This is exactly the purpose of mutable templates: to allow type variations in data mappings. The evaluation we performed in E-Dvara has suggested us that the flexibility of mutable templates (i.e. evolving schemata) must be considered as an essential feature for our platform.","refs":[{"start":58,"end":59,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_3"}]},{"text":"Technical infrastructure adaptation Other issues we have faced is the need for integrating new heterogeneous modules at the top of the digital library (e.g. virtual museums, meta-search engines, or applications for mobile devices). These requests posed unforeseen challenges on the software infrastructure. For each new application, we needed to rewrite a lot of ad-hoc business logic, without mentioning the fact that we had to duplicate some system services in order to adapt them to a new programming interface. Another tricky aspect was sharing similar behaviors and data located in different components which were based on incompatible communication protocols. These issues clearly demanded for a reusable integration layer that we lacked as part of our initial software architecture. Moreover, we have learned also that integrating several applications in a common environment requires a substantial investment in understanding and implementing their orchestration, in order to handle incompatibilities between different business logics in a standard and transparent way. In conclusion, in our first prototype we failed to recognize the importance of these issues, which are the building blocks to describe the interaction between different applications. If we had realized that since the beginning, composing together heterogeneous functionalities would be simpler to achieve. Furthermore, also the resulting deployment would be expedited, especially by moving the orchestration logic from the inside of a component to an external configuration file (i.e. by means of a XML description file associated to each component), enabling a flexible and dynamic setup.","refs":[]}]},{"title":"Coordination issues of different user roles and workflows","paragraphs":[{"text":"The continuous integration of different applications on the top of the existing software infrastructure were typically a manifestation of new requirements involving user roles and information access policies. An example of this situation is an external service which, based on its own data management policy, defines when a particular workflow is required to organize the archived contents. In E-Dvara, a workflow expresses a set of roles, related activities, and constraints that define together the structure of the information manage-ment process. As a typical workflow, consider the curator of a digital museum which has to arrange a new gallery, composed by paintings, ancient books, and movies hosted in three archives, respectively, and owned also by three different archivists. When the curator wants to incorporate in this gallery a set of features to search, organize, and enrich the existing records, he may want to add new fields describing position that each item should have in the virtual museum scene. Moreover, final users may also improve the exhibition quality, by creating new relations between existing contents (e.g. opinions and links to a specific related content in a typical Web 2.0 style). All these scenarios pose many issues that must be faced to provide flexibility in data management. Such issues concern intellectual property (Who is allowed to use/modify a content?), coupling between archives (How do the schemata of archive B evolve according to the evolution of both schemata and data in archive A, if any dependency between A and B exists?) and coupling between workflows (Do the activities in the workflow A overlap those in workflow B?).","refs":[]}]},{"title":"Handling evolution of content production workflows","paragraphs":[{"text":"This section describes three conceptual model elements (the XML metamodel, the service-oriented architecture, and the multi-agent infrastructure), each one associated to a specific evolution dimension introduced in Section 4.1.

At the bottom of the hierarchy, we place the records (level M0, Record Model), aimed at representing the archived data (documents). A record is an instance of a document stored in the digital platform. Every document must also conform to a document template (level M1, Template Model), which provides structural definitions (e.g. the document contains the Title, Author, and Date fields) and constraints (e.g. the Data field must conform to the mm/dd/yy format or the Title field is mandatory). Document templates are themselves conformed to platform template (level M2, Platform Template Model) devoted to define both business rules and data types the archivists can use to build document templates (e.g. each record in every archive must contain the Creation Date and Owner fields). Finally, platform templates are instances of a more general layer, the platform meta-model (level M3, Platform Meta-Model), which defines a set of common low-level structures (e.g. primitive data types as xsd:String) and operations (e.g. data sequencing) available in order to define more complex data structures.

In this section, we introduce a multi-agent approach to tackle the problem, aimed (when possible) to automatically resolve evolution issues. The levels from M1 to M3, proposed in Figure 4, can be affected by updates during the digital library life-cycle. In particular, such updates can involve XML Schema definitions (level M3, with a low frequency), Platform Template Models (level M2, with a low-medium frequency) and Template Models (level M1, with a rather high frequency). Each schema is connected by a dependency link with the schemata on its top for val-idation purposes. However, in a collection one level can be related to another also by means of relations between different data types (e.g. an instance of the template Book in M1 can be related with one or more instances of the template Author in M0). At the same time, we can also have a relation connecting templates in different collections (e.g. instances of the template GalleryRoom in a virtual museum application can be related with instances of Book and Painting templates taken from different collections). Hence, such dependencies requires evolution mechanisms that must be propagated both in a specific level and across multiple levels. This propagation mechanism is achieved by means of a multi-agent system. Each agent is assigned to a specific schema, monitoring its evolution; an agent can interact with other agents assigned to depending schemata, send them messages and apply evolution to the instances of its schema.","refs":[{"start":439,"end":440,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_3"}]},{"text":"A coordinator agent is assigned to each instance of the platform, in order to monitor the updates of the Platform Template Model and to activate the agents connected to each schema when required.

Agents perform several evolutionary operation on data, in order to preserve data validity and, at the same time, to prevent archivists and content editors to spend a lot of time re-entering the whole set of existing contents. In [14,15] a complete taxonomy of updates, which can affect a generic XML schema, is described; actually only a subset of the listed operations has been implemented in E-Dvara, covering the set of updates which can be performed by archivists. For example, we provide the utilities to rename or add elements and attributes of the Template Model (level M1). In order to cope with the complexity of the evolution tasks and the amount of data yet available in E-Dvara, our attention is focused on simple updates which commonly occur during the life-cycle of a collection. A typical evolution task is represented by the extraction of a vocabulary (a closed list of predefined strings) from the set of values assigned to a free-text String element. In our experience such an update is rather frequent, specifically when we are not able to know a priori all the values assignable to a specific element. In this case, when an archivist decides to change the type of the element Name from String to Vocabulary, the agent assigned to that schema should access each instance of the template and perform a change item type, verifying if the old values assigned to Name are validated with respect to the values admitted by the new element type. When this task is completed, the agent should notify the schema updates to the related agents (according to the dependency chain between schemata), in order to grant the consistency of any inter-dependent data.","refs":[{"start":439,"end":443,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b14"},{"start":443,"end":446,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b15"}]}]},{"title":"Toward semantic digital libraries","paragraphs":[{"text":"In Section 5 our attention was focused on handling evolution issues from the content providers point of view, more focused on data schemata and publication services.

Moreover, starting a digital library initiative requires to handle several evolution issues (the need of new roles, workflows, and types of contents, the availability of new applications to integrate on the top of digital archives, etc.). To catch all these aspects, we outline a conceptual model based on three complementary domains: informational, technological, and social. This model tackles the typical issues affecting a digital library, especially concerning the evolution (i.e. change) of content, infrastructure (software tools), user roles, and related workflows in content creation, publication, and exploitation. These issues are addressed in the model by means of three elements: a suitable XML data metamodel, a service-oriented architecture, and a multi-agent infrastructure. The XML metamodel abstracts the physical representation from the logical definition of data, making easier future changes. The multi-agent infrastructure helps to preserve the consistency of the stored archives when their schemata need to be changed. Finally, the service-oriented architecture simplifies the integration of new applications at the top of the digital library. As part of this architecture, we describe in particular a specific component: the PIRATES framework. This module introduces in the digital library a set of semantic services aimed at assisting final users to select from the archives the most appropriate content.
