The volume of scientific artefacts has increased significantly in recent years, and this trend is destined to grow in volume and velocity. Hence, it becomes difficult for researchers to discover relevant papers, datasets, software, etc. In such a situation, recommender systems come to assist the researchers.

Furthermore, they introduce three classes of collaborative filtering methods: memory-based, model-based, In the third phase, we constructed the search strings with identified keywords to query scientific repositories.

They captured users' interests explicitly by asking them to express their preferences and implicitly by looking into the contact duration and contact frequency between active participants and other participants. Zhao et al. [13] used the user's research interest network, an undirected connected graph. The nodes of the graph represent the users, and the edge represents the similarity of interests between two users. A threshold-based method is applied to obtain groups (of users) with similar research interests based on this network. Wang et al. [14] use a hybrid approach in the individual prediction phase and an aggregation technique based on the ER rule in the group aggregation phase. Wang et al. [15] propose a group-oriented paper recommendation method based on probabilistic matrix factorisation and evidential reasoning. The proposed method has three main steps: individual paper recommendation, individual prediction aggregation, and group recommendation. In the individual paper recommendation step, the researcher similarity and paper similarity indicators are calculated. These indicators are integrated into the probabilistic matrix factorisation model to improve performance and produce a more accurate prediction for each group member. In the step of aggregating the individual predictions, the predicted rating of each group member is merged into a group rating by the rule ER. In the final step, group recommendation, the top-k papers with the highest predicted ratings are recommended to the target group.","refs":[{"start":151,"end":155,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b11"},{"start":155,"end":158,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b12"},{"start":158,"end":161,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b13"},{"start":161,"end":164,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b14"},{"start":181,"end":185,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b11"},{"start":612,"end":616,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b12"},{"start":937,"end":941,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b13"},{"start":1093,"end":1097,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b14"}]},{"text":"The majority of studies (205) focus on recommending to the individual researcher.","refs":[]},{"text":"There are different ways to represent a user (actually user's interests) for recommender systems.

In user profile based approaches, the system constructs a representation of the user preferences (the profile).

In graph-based approaches, the system relies on \"connections\" / \"links\" between nodes representing users. For instance, Huynh et al.

Any recommender system algorithm or machine learning algorithm requires transforming the text into numeric or vector representation. This vector representation has to illustrate the characteristics of the text. There are many techniques to represent a text for recommender system algorithms; in this project, we categorised them into five categories: TF-IDF, Topic modelling, Word embedding, Graph embedding, and Mixed.

As discussed in Sec. 3.2, recommender systems can use several ways to extract the insights and represent the items, like Word embedding and Topic modelling. After building the user's profile and the item's profile, CBF computes the similarity between the user profile and the item profile. After ranking the items regarding the similarity, the higher ranking items are recommended to researchers. Since the CBF is based on extracting the user profile features and then calculating the similarity between items profile and user profile, the recommended items are recognised better.

In comparison to the CBF, CF is independent of the content of the items [6]. In other words, there is no need to extract the features of the recommended item and build the user profile. Moreover, CF can provide serendipitous recommendations because the similarity is calculated between the users' relationships, not based on items and user profiles [6].

In bibliographic coupling, if two articles have common references are considered relevant. In co-citation, two papers are relevant if cited together in another paper [45]. The recommendation process of the graph-based recommender systems has two phases: the construction of the graph and the generation of recommendations [7]. The graph-based recommender system represents the users and items with a heterogeneous graph [7]. The recommendation progress will be performed as a graph search task in the graph-based model. In the case of the recommender system for scientific domains, one of the main types of Graph-based recommender systems commonly used is the citation network.
