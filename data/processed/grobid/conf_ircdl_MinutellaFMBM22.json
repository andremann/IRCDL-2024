are widely used to represent data in many applications over the Internet. Social networks, transaction networks, collaboration networks, and all those cases in which data is composed of entities and relations between them take advantage of the graph structure. One of the main fields in which this kind of structure is deeply used is the scholarly communication, where research products are organized in graphs, such as the OpenAIRE Research Graph [1][2] [3]. Algorithms operating on such graphs need to exploit the links among nodes to understand the whole spectrum of relationships among the different entities. With the advent of deep learning, many architectures were proposed to explicitly deal with relationships, for example in the context of information retrieval [4] or multimodal matching [5]. Over the past decade, many algorithms were proposed to operate with heterogeneous graphs, i.e. graphs that contain different types of nodes and edges. An algorithm over a heterogeneous graph works by extracting its homogeneous forms using the metapath approach. This approach consists in replacing the link chain between two entities of the same type with a direct link. For example, in a graph with actors and movies in which a relation between the entities indicates that the actor played a role in the movie, the actor-movie-actor metapath extracts the homogeneous form that contains only actor nodes, with edges encoding the played a role in the same movie relationship. Although Graph Neural Networks (GNN) seem very prominent in this field, their applicability is limited in large knowledge graphs. In many cases, in fact, a subgraph sampling may be required when the graph is dense, while the addition of virtual nodes may be necessary when the graph is too sparse.","refs":[{"start":462,"end":465,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b0"},{"start":469,"end":472,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b2"},{"start":786,"end":789,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b3"},{"start":813,"end":816,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b4"}]},{"text":"In the light of these observations, we propose an efficient and scalable pipeline to process very large heterogeneous knowledge graphs. Our objective consists in classifying the nodes in the graph given the node attributes and the node neighborhood. We target the IMDb dataset, the world's most popular and authoritative database for movie, TV, and celebrity content, where the target movie classes to infer are Action, Drama or Comedy. The proposed approach leverages the metapath approach to obtain multiple but simpler homogeneous graphs and constructs node embeddings using FastRP, a widely-used random projection algorithm. Then, an attentive neural network is trained in an unsupervised manner to aggregate information from different metapaths and produce embeddings suitable for effective node classification.

In order to account for the attributes of nodes -the genre, the duration or the year of a movie, for example -virtual nodes and virtual edges are used. Those virtual elements define additional metapaths that capture the topological information from the point of view of node attributes. A feature can be categorical -for example, when the value is taken from a list that encodes the genre -or numeric. A categorical feature can be represented in the graph by adding a virtual node for each value that the feature can assume. Differently, a numeric feature can be represented in the graph as a single node. The value that an actual node assumes for that feature is represented as a weighted link, with the weight indicating the numeric value for that feature.
