This is particularly true for institutional repositories, whose mission is that of growing a complete collection of the scientific publications produced by the authors affiliated to the institution they serve. Repository managers' goal is twofold: bringing in the collection all articles produced by such authors and making sure the metadata is as complete and up-to-date as possible. To this aim, the infrastructure is currently being equipped with the OpenAIRE Literature Broker Service (OLBS) whose general principles and ideas are described in [16]. The OLBS implements a subscription and notification mechanism supporting repository managers at enhancing the content of their repository taking advantage of the OpenAIRE information space. As reported in [16], a number of initiatives started working on \"brokering\" approaches favoring singledeposition of publication metadata with subsequent automated delivery to other repositories. Some focused on techniques for automatic deposition into a repository (SWORD project [4]), while others focused on the complementary aspects of how to broker publication information from publishers to relevant/interested repositories. SHARE [3] and JISC/EDINA [9] are two of such initiatives, based respectively in the U.S. and U.K. The OpenAIRE Literature Broker Service (OLB Service) offers to repository managers the possibility to subscribe to special \"addition\" or \"enrichment\" events, in order to be respectively notified about: (i) publication objects in OpenAIRE that do not appear in their collection but may be pertinent to it, or (ii) properties or relationships relative to publication objects in their collection that do not appear in their local metadata. Due to the high variability of the OpenAIRE information space, where new data sources are continuously added or removed, harmonization rules, mining, and deduplication algorithms are refined, following problems may arise: (i) subscriptions may vary over time to adapt to information space evolution, (ii) repository managers need to be able to quickly test their configurations before activating them, (iii) the same notifications may be sent more than once, and (iv) notifications may be very large in number over time.

Notifications are entries of the form: timestamp, openaireID, Subscription Type, repositoryId, trust, title, Authors, Publication Date, DCRecord; where timestamp is the notification date (the same for all notifications identified and sent in the same Phase 2 session). Starting from the potential notifications identified in Phase 2, currently kept in memory, in Phase 3 the OLBS searches the notifications collection in order select which potential notifications are eligible to become new notifications, thereby avoiding multiple delivery of the same notifications to the same repositories. Only new notifications will be fed to the index and be sent to the repositories according to the requested notification strategy.","refs":[]}]},{"title":"Conclusions","paragraphs":[{"text":"The first BETA instantiation of the OLBS will be available by June 2016. The next steps are the generalization of the core of the OLBS to become a general-purpose Literature Broker Service, ready to support the same functionalities independently of the context. To this aim, the data model and internal representations of the OLBS, together with the acquired experience in operating the service, will inspire the definition of standard exchange formats and APIs to achieve interoperability across a network of similar services world-wide (collaborations are active with JISC-UK and SHARE-US). Concepts such as notification broker services, literature subscriptions/notifications descriptions, subscription/notification APIs should be agreed on, conform to existing standards 7 , and shared across the community and become a common way to share objects across repositories.","refs":[{"start":775,"end":776,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_7"}]}]}],"tables":{},"abstract":{"title":"Abstract","paragraphs":[{"text":"The OpenAIRE infrastructure is the point of reference for Open Science in Europe. Its services populate and provide access to a graph of objects relative to publications, datasets, people, organizations, projects, and funders aggregated from a variety of data sources, such as institutional repositories, data archives, journals, and CRIS systems. Not only, objects in the graph are harmonized to achieve semantic homogeneity, de-duplicated and merged, and enriched by inference with missing properties and/or relationships. The OpenAIRE Literature Broker Service is designed to offer subscription and notification functionalities for institutional repositories to: (i) learn about publication objects in Open-AIRE that do not appear in their collection but may be pertinent to it, and (ii) learn about extra properties or relationships relative to publication objects in their collection. Due to the high variability of the information space the following problems may arise: (i) subscriptions may vary over time to adapt to information space evolution, (ii) repository managers need to be able to quickly test their configurations before activating them, (iii) notifications may be redundant, and (iv) notifications may be very large over time. This paper presents the data model and software architecture of the OLBS, specifically designed to address these issues.","refs":[]}]}}
