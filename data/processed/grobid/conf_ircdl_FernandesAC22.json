In the total of 5 years of collection, 23 empirical studies were counted, which means, case studies that took place in certain environments and contexts [11], such as case studies dedicated to libraries in Brazil and Portugal stand out. Despite the journal being published in Portugal, there were more articles published about libraries in Brazil (11 articles) than in Portugal (9 articles). It should also be noted that of the 29 articles, all written in Portuguese, except for 1 that was written in Spanish. Regarding bibliographic references, an average of 25 references per article was cited, totaling 733 bibliographical references, which were grouped by typology. Thus, the widely used typologies, with more than 200 references each, were scientific articles (32%) and books (29%), and with less than 100 references each, followed by proceedings (10%) and book chapters (8%).

Also, it is remarkable the use of an 1898 article on the citation patterns of doctoral students from the Department of Geology of the University of Helsinki, Finland, as a reference for an article on the citation pattern of master's degree students.

It is interesting to note that of the most cited authors, 8 are Brazilian, 3 Portuguese, 1 North-American, 1 Spanish, and 1 an international institution. Next, we will discuss the most cited authors, namely: IFLA (International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions), Oswaldo Francisco de Almeida Júnior, and Antonio Carlos Gil. IFLA's most cited documents are co-authorship with UNESCO and are publications about library and library services. IFLA is an independent, non-governmental, not-for-profit organization, founded in 1927 in Scotland [12]. It can be considered the leading body representing the interests of the information professionals. They have published a wide range of manifestos that discourse about several library topics such as public libraries, school libraries, digital libraries among others. Those manifestos define concepts and are considered as the basis for the constitution of libraries and services to be provided for them. It is interesting to note that IFLA not only has documents in the referenced languages but its manifestos are often translated into multiple languages. Thus, it is possible to notice that of the 29 analyzed articles, 10 of them used 16 IFLAs references translated into Portuguese and Spanish. Of these articles that cite IFLA, 8of them are empirical studies that discuss case studies in libraries that deal with various aspects such as reference services, school libraries aspects, library education, relevant legislation, planning and management practices, among other topics that need direction, on which IFLA already has manifests that direct about its applications. And 2 of them are theoretical studies, which discuss the social role of the librarian and the reading mediation, and for that, they base their analyzes on the public library and the school using IFLA manifestos.","refs":[{"start":260,"end":261,"marker":"table","target":"#tab_1"},{"start":863,"end":867,"marker":"bibr","target":null}]},{"text":"The second most cited author was Oswaldo Francisco de Almeida Júnior. His works about information competence and information mediation were cited in 3 articles and were cited 8 times. Almeida Júnior is a professor of Information Science in three different Brazilian Universities. He has experience in the field of Information Science, with an emphasis on Information and Society, working mainly on the following topics: Information and Society, Information Mediation, Reference and Information Service, Public Libraries, and Librarianship [13]. As demonstrated from the analyzed references, the author publishes primarily in Portuguese and as a single author. But some references are co-authored, and those were mostly published with authors such Camila Araújo dos Santos [14], Regina Celia Baptista Belluzzo [15], and João Arlindo dos Santos Neto [16] that are also Universities professors in Brazil and develop studies in the field of Information Science as well.","refs":[{"start":539,"end":543,"marker":"bibr","target":null}]},{"text":"And the third most cited author was Antônio Carlos Gil.

This particular author was the only one with a high number of citations (6 times) in only one article. When under a more specific analysis, we noted that all those references were self-citations. Although self-citation was not a forbidden practice, it is not recommended, as mentioned by Almeida and Cardoso [19], since citation metrics become an instrument to measure the impact factor of the scientific paper and also of the scientist itself.

Still, regarding the citations, it is observed that 77% of the references were published after the year 2000, denoting the preference for the most recent citations. However, references prior to the 20th century were used, and most of them did not have a plausible justification for their use.
