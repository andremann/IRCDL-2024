The data integration platform will also allow users to extract relevant entities and other valuable information from datasets originally encoded by the partners in a variety of standards in a new integrated digital environment. The platform relies on a modular architectureintegrating custom components realized by the RESTORE dev team with existing solutions already available -to support the conversion of the digital resources provided by the project partners, to the CIDOC-CRM ontology. Among the supported formats: TEI 3 for texts; EDM 4 and MAG 5 , MODS, METS 6 for content produced by libraries; EAD 7 and EAC 8 for archives; ICCD-OA 9 for museum collections; formats in use in the heritage science like EDF 10 , HDF5 11 . The final version of the RESTORE platform will also include components for data ingestion and storage (i.e. CKAN 12 ) data management, access and integration (based on the Virtuoso 13 triplestore). 4567891011121314 Starting from a keen analysis of the original datasets, taking into account the specific production context (e.g. libraries, archives, museums, etc.) and the integration requirements expressed by the partners, the team designed and implemented a set of custom solutions, including tools for the normalization, syntactic alignment and semantic modeling of data. using the CIDOC-CRM 14 as the reference ontology, allowing the representation of both tangible and intangible aspects of cultural heritage artifacts. 15 In this contribution, the integration methods so far implemented are presented, with a focus on the sources provided by the Archivio di Stato di Prato 15 , the Museo di Palazzo Pretorio 16 and the Istituto Opera del Vocabolario Italiano (cfr. note 3).

It is, therefore, necessary to set up a workflow that not only allows the semantization of data within a single reference domain, but also proposes a shared data processing model, valid for multiple metadata schemes and for multiple standards. On the technical side, it was necessary to clean the data before processing, to remove elements resulting from incorrect data processing (i.e. use of different management tools, standards and styles) undermining its understanding.","refs":[]},{"text":"The technical phase is accompanied by a periodic focus with domain experts, to carefully analyze the materials to be treated and the effectiveness of the solutions provided by the team. Following the feedback provided, the team aims to implement a navigation environment that holds in itself the semantic meanings discussed with domain experts. This is possible by structuring the data as a semantic dataset and by defining the relationships that exist between entities. 2627 As a first step taken in data management, the original resources were uploaded to a data store, for storage and access: the team has activated an instance of the CKAN tool (cfr. note 14) in which the original XML files, i.e. the sources provided by the partner institutions, are stored and described. In fact, CKAN allows for the description of datasets by means of an association of the original metadata files to its own metadata system (so, it essentially results as a description of the data collection). The project workflow involves the transformation of the data provided, regardless of the original format, into semantic triples 25 . A \"triple\" is a statement on the semantic data, expressed using a set of three elements: Subject, Object and Predicate; the triples are the smallest building blocks for the RDF 26 format. A triple, therefore, is the result of an arrangement of the data itself in the form of subjectpredicate-object expressions, where the different components of the expression can be associated with a single and unique URI 27 , or sequences of characters specifically identifying the resources that have been mapped and \"transferred\" in a semantic context. The conversion of the original data into triples was carried out through the use of custom parsers 28 . 2829 The first parser of the workflow takes in input the original data sources, and outputs them in the form of tables results encoded in a CSV 29 format, following a 1:1 ratio (the corresponding CSV file is produced for each original file). So, the program processes the original data by ordering them in a predetermined way, corresponding to the display of the same aggregated data in tabular form. The next step in data processing involves transforming the information contained in the CSV tables into triples, in the TTL 30 format. This phase is also achieved through the use of a parser implemented ad hoc in Python. Data triplication of the data, or the conversion of the same from the table format (CSV) into triples (TTL), implies a further analysis of the data, for it is based on the nature of the information to be conveyed. It is, therefore, necessary to make the following operations: i) choosing the most relevant information (with the help from experts in the relevant scientific domain); ii) specifying the meaning of the information to be represented (depending on the context of use, etc.); iii) providing for the actual modeling in CIDOC-CRM, choosing the appropriate entities and properties. 3031 In the context of the activities described, the mapping indicates a process of aligning information of the same kind, though contained in different datasets, and expressed through different semantic schemes and/or structures -through the combination of elements belonging to one dataset with those of another dataset if both express the same concept (eg: signature, author, place, etc.).","refs":[{"start":471,"end":475,"marker":"bibr","target":null},{"start":1759,"end":1761,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b1"},{"start":1764,"end":1768,"marker":"bibr","target":null},{"start":2976,"end":2980,"marker":"bibr","target":null}]},{"text":"The data mapping phase facilitates the migration of data to be converted into logical constructs articulated on the basis of the CIDOC-CRM model. The ontology provides the developers with a model of management and semantic representation of knowledge bases allowing for defining a set of concepts and describing fundamental relationships between them. The finality of the process is to formalize the knowledge (i.e.: translate it into a formal language 31 ), so as to minimize its ambiguity 32 (typical of natural language) and make it \"computable\", machine readable, through a module called reasoner, so the calculator can make inferences about it. Through the modeling, the data becomes structured according to the rules of the reference ontology, which will form the basis for the transformation of the datasets into triples. 3233 To proceed with the mapping and modeling it was necessary to conduct an in-depth study of the EAD and EAC standards archival data encoded with such a standards [2][3]; an in-depth study of the ICCD regulations (OA forms, regulation 3.00, 2018) for the entries regarding the collections of works of art [4]; an in-depth study of the TEI standard for the representation of texts in digital format [5]; the study and selection of the reference ontology which could better be used as a semantic basis to build the triples. Through the use of the common ontology, the data were integrated and aligned to the CIDOC-CRM entities and properties. Of particular interest are the entities that in the mapping phase were identified as possible points of alignment between the different datasets, present in all the resources: persons, places, objects. The effective integration of the data, is based on the reference to a unique identifier (ie: a unique and possibly persistent URI) for the entities common to multiple datasets (ie: the toponym Prato, or the anthroponym Francesco di Marco Datini), which constitutes the point of contact between competing or ambiguous descriptions, and/or different information relating to the same objects (i.e.: people, places, etc.) coming from different information contexts (archives, museums, libraries, etc.).","refs":[{"start":491,"end":493,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b3"},{"start":829,"end":833,"marker":"bibr","target":null}]},{"text":"After a deep analysis of the standard used by the different institutions that provided the database of the project we started the modeling activity from the elements identified as conjunction points between the collections at disposal, following the chosen ontology, CIDOC-CRM. In addition to the ontology (a scheme) it was also necessary to select a series of reference vocabularies, for each domain of interest (authors, artists, places, etc.). Through the references to vocabularies it was possible to identify and index toponyms and anthroponyms, two of the entities identified as points of contact between the various datasets, and general concepts both materials and immaterials. The common entities that occur in the different datasets will therefore have to share the link to the reference vocabulary. In this way, the integration of data on entities that refer to the same anthroponym or toponym is achieved.

For this reason, the E22 Man-Made Object CIDOC-CRM class has been used for representing the object, which the information refers to. Actually, the alignment to the CIDOC-CRM ontology made it necessary to distinguish between two levels of understanding in regards to the description of the objects treated. The artifacts (man-made objects, such as texts, works of art, written records of any kind) were, in fact, considered both as a product of intellectual work -as an \"idea\" (the stages of its commission and design by the author/artist) -and as physical, tangible manifestation of the same type of work (as elements forming part of a physically identifiable collection and, therefore, placed, musealised or archived, protected and even kept by organizations and \"personas'' throughout history).","refs":[]},{"text":"The first level designates the immaterial (intangible) aspect of the work from the moment of its creation (even if only conceptual), while the second level describes its production and transposition onto a physical (tangible) support.

CIDOC-CRM ontology provides the P14 carried out by property to define the person responsible for an event. However, using only this property it is not possible to define the role of the author with respect to the event, so all roles are modelled as qualifications of the same person without distinction of the role carried out with respect to the different events in which he may have participated. It is therefore necessary to distinguish between the different roles played by the people involved in the creation and production of the object. To do this it is necessary to extend the CIDOC-CRM ontology with the CRM-PC schema, which introduces, among others, the property P14.1 in the role of.

The relationship between these places has been mapped with CIDOC through instances of E10 Transfer of Custody: the chronology of the different passages can be reconstructed and thus the actual passage of custody can be mapped 37 . If the temporal data had not been available, it would have been possible to use only the property P49 has former or current keeper, which associates the physical object with its current and/or previous custodians and which is also a \"shortcut\" to the more detailed path represented by the event described by the class E10 Transfer of Custody. 38 Instead, it was decided to map the event in order to be able to keep track of the history expressed in the OA tab. The last documented custodian of the work is actually reported in LC (current geoadministrative location), which describes the current custodian of the work. So the last custody step is between the last geo-administrative location reported in LA (based on the chronology) and the location reported in LC. All the entities described are or have been keepers of the work. In order to express the chronology (E52 Time-span), the PRDI field has been used (custody start date at the institution to which it refers), to indicate the date on which the custody transfer event from one institution to another took place.","refs":[{"start":616,"end":618,"marker":"bibr","target":null},{"start":964,"end":966,"marker":"bibr","target":null}]}]},{"title":"Exchange of letters","paragraphs":[{"text":"The E9 Move event is used to describe changes to the physical position, i.e. the movement of the physical object.

This class, focusing on the movement of the object, proved not to be the best solution for the representation of information related to correspondence: a typology that involves the sending and receiving of a document and therefore needs to express also essential information on the recipient and the sender. It was necessary, therefore, to implement a new class, EL1 Exchange of letters, having as superclass E7 Activity, for the definition of the exchange of letters. The two subclasses EL2 Send letter and EL3 Receive letter, indicate more specifically the activity of sending and receiving a letter.

Those thus listed, are very versatile tools that allow in-depth semantic searches; however, they are not really user-friendly. Therefore, having a user-friendly interface where data consultation and browsing does not require knowledge of the sparql language becomes a must, and it should allow for easy navigation, independent from the users' web proficiency. In fact, the hypothesized target is very heterogeneous in terms of digital literacy, ranging from citizens interested in research activities to the experts in a research infrastructure. It is therefore necessary to have more or less specialized search options, depending on the targeted user's familiarity with surfing the net, and on the level of expertise in the topic object of the webquest. For this reason, the platform offers different data visualization solutions (in practice, each target segment must have its own specific offer). The team wants to stress particularly on the definition and visualization of the relationships established between the several entities described in the data.","refs":[]},{"text":"In brief, the platform should make the data visible, modellable, savable and downloadable by all users. All these operations must be made available within the platform. RESTORE develops a user-friendly interface to let users browse the data regardless of their web literacy. The interface is, nonetheless, one of the means, though the more intuitive and visually appealing, by which the users interact with the data in the Virtuoso Triplestore. The interface simulates the queries and allows the user to navigate the semantic relationships established between data using CIDOC-CRM ontology. In fact, the aim of the platform is to have different ways of visualization and browsing of information, so that the user can find the resource of interest and read the information on the institution website that provided the information. For instance, a search made on \"Francesco di Marco Datini\" gives records as results standing for letters, registries or person's information; the user can scroll and refine the results and then, by selecting one among the entris, be linked to the institutions' website. In fact, RESTORE doesn't want to build a pure visualization tool of archival entries or artwork entries, given that those are already made available by the partners' interfaces. What the project achieves is the integration of data in a semantic environment that will activate new ways to reveal information through the relationships mapped during the previous stages of the work. In this perspective, the purpose of the RESTORE interface is to make this browsing activity simple for all users, and to effectively link the resource in a multifaceted context.","refs":[]},{"text":"At the moment, an alpha version of the search interface was deployed and a testing session is set.

Moreover, a customized view is being implemented with a specialized software: EVT (Edition Visualization Technology) is an advanced software tool for digital scholarly editions. EVT was chosen because it respects the following requirements: it is a lightweight, open source tool specifically designed to create digital editions from encoded texts in the XML format, allowing the user to browse, explore and study the digital editions through a user-friendly interface. Currently, EVT 3, the latest version to be released in January 2022, is being used for current development.
