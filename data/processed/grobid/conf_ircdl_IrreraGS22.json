Configuration. MedTAG was designed to be easily configurable via a dedicated web-interface. At the moment of the configuration, the user is asked to provide the collection of clinical documents (or reports) to be annotated, the labels needed to perform document-level annotation and the concepts belonging to one or more ontologies. All the files must be uploaded in CSV format. In addition, it is possible to specify the parts of the uploaded reports where annotation is allowed. The file containing clinical reports can be replaced by (or provided with) a CSV containing a list of PubMed articles' identifiers. MedTAG automatically extracts the identifiers and downloads the title, the abstract and some additional information of each article. Annotation is allowed on title and abstract sections. MedTAG supports the upload of new batches of reports, new sets of labels and concepts at will, without losing the existing annotations. In order to make the configuration easier and faster, MedTAG offers downloadable CSV templates and provides the user with information about what changes need to be applied to the uploaded CSVs to make them comply with the required format.","refs":[]},{"text":"User interface.

The latter two are mention-level annotations: in this case the annotation refers to one or more text spans (mentions) in the original textual content. Labels annotation consists in associating one or more labels to the textual report; a label is a property that describes the report. Concepts annotation consists in associating one or more ontological concepts to the report. Mentions annotation consists in identifying entity mentions. In order to identify a mention, the user can either click on the first and on the last words composing the mention, or click on every single adjacent word of the mention in the textual report on the left. The identified mentions are characterized by different colors so to be immediately detected. In Figure 1 the annotated mentions are highlighted in blue, yellow and green respectively. Linking consists in associating one or more ontological concepts to a mention. Ontological concepts in Linking and Concepts annotation can be added via a drop-down menu with auto-completion facilities, this allows the user to type the desired concept without examining all the ontological concepts. In Figure 1, each mention has been linked to its corresponding concept. Each annotation can be either saved or deleted by clicking on Save and Clear button respectively. Nevertheless, the annotation is automatically saved when the report or the annotation type change. Annotators can benefit from annotations created by other users they share MedTAG with.
