In this paper we define a framework to collect and represent information from different web resources like search engines, real-time networks and multimedia distributed databases. A prototype system has been developed, following the Rich Internet Application paradigm, to allow end-users to visualize, browse and analyze documents and their relationships in a graph-based user interface. Different visual paradigms have been implemented and their effectiveness has been measured in usability tests with real users.","refs":[]}]}}
