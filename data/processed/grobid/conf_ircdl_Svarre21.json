Several empirical studies of library websites illustrate this phenomenon. For example, Dougan and Fulton [15], in their usability study of an academic library website, found issues both with the specificity of terms and general problems in understanding the website terminology. General confusion in terms of terminology was also identified in Tidal's [16] study of an academic library website. Knowledge organising systems play an important role in reducing the vocabulary problem and explicating the content that vocabulary represents, but, clearly, they should be developed with an understanding of user terminology to support users in their interaction with the websites and the content.","refs":[{"start":138,"end":142,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b12"},{"start":142,"end":145,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b13"},{"start":403,"end":407,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b14"},{"start":650,"end":654,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b15"}]},{"text":"Morville et al.

Another category of high-frequency terms relates to the library as a service function. This category is exemplified by terms like \"Way\" (representing street names and wayfinding in Danish), \"Contact\", \"Booking\", and \"Opening\", inviting users to use the library and library services like assistance from a trained librarian.

For instance, the Danish Film Institute (CINEMA) and the Design Museum (DESMUS) libraries are so similar that they end up in the same cluster. If the next level of the cluster is considered, they are also connected to another museum, the Royal Danish Defence Academy Library (FB).

They represent a large variation in their use of labels, both in numbers and variety. Previous research has identified challenges with library jargon on academic library websites [e.g. 16]. Considering the most frequent labels used in the current study, the deliberate use of terminology does not appear to be prevalent. However, users should be involved in further studies to obtain a deeper understanding of this issue. The cluster analysis revealed that academic libraries with similar purposes also tend to be similar in their use of labelling. Independent sample T-tests did not reveal that this can be explained by whether the libraries are incorporated into their host institutions' websites and thereby have institution labels as part of their pool of labels. Instead, it seems that the specific use of labels is similar, for instance, between university college libraries, between some museum libraries and between the two Danish schools of architecture. The findings indicate that the libraries in their labelling draw on a shared terminology within their domains, which is a step towards reducing the vocabulary problem in information interaction. Further studies with users within the specific domains can further elaborate on how they understand and experience the vocabulary problem within their domains.","refs":[]}]}],"tables":{"tab_0":{"heading":"Table 1 .","description":"Included libraries","rows":[["Abbreviation","Library name","Type of library"],["AARCH","Aarhus School of Architecture Library","UNI"],["ABSAL","University College Absalon Library","UC"],["ARBMUS","The Workers' Museum Library","OTHER"],["AUB","Aalborg University Library","UNI"],["CBS","Copenhagen Business School Library","UNI"],["CINEMA","Danish Film Institute Library","OTHER"],["DESMUS","Design Museum Denmark Library","OTHER"],["DIIS","Danish Institute for International Studies Library OTHER"],["DKDM","The Royal Danish Academy of Music Library","UNI"],["DST","Statistics Denmark Library","OTHER"],["DTU","Technical University of Denmark Library","UNI"],["FB","Royal Danish Defence Academy Library","OTHER"],["KADK","The Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts Library UNI"],["KB","The Danish Royal Library","UNI/OTHER"],["PHB","Copenhagen University College Library","UC"],["POLAR","Polar Library","UNI"],["SDUB","University of Southern Denmark Library","UNI"],["UCLB","UCL University College Library","UC"],["UCNB","UCN University College Library","UC"],["UCSB","University College South Denmark Library","UC"],["VIAB","VIA University College Library","UC"],["Legend: The libraries are divided into three categories by purpose: UNI (serving a university or"],["university-like institution), UC (serving a university college) and OTHER (serving other types"],["of institutions like museums or organisations).",""]]},"tab_1":{"heading":"Table 2 .","description":"Number of labels, average length of labels and average number of label terms","rows":[["","Mean Minimum Maximum Standard deviation"],["Number of labels","98.76","29","378","84.97"],["Length of labels (characters)","16.66","2","43","8.57"],["Number of terms","2.25","1","9","1.37"]]}},"abstract":{"title":"Abstract","paragraphs":[{"text":"This paper studies labels on Danish academic library websites.
