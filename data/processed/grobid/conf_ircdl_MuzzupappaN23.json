Moreover, the order and specificity with which the same topics are dealt with vary from one grammar to another. In addition, although the books are divided into chapters, sections and paragraphs, sometimes there are no titles associated with them, while in other cases the authors presented generic titles for different topics. It was the reader's task to understand to which part of speech the author was referring to. So, to make them identifiable in our database, we need to do the same without altering the original structure of the text.","refs":[]},{"text":"A second important point is dialogues. They are usually presented in a graphic form divided into two columns: the first in Spanish (or the original language), the second contains the Italian translation.

This is the reason why, Spanish dialogues accompanied by Italian translations are a useful tool to identify register, context, terms and lexical collocations within a broad, organic and elaborated speech. This is true for the oral plan of the Spanish language too. A similar consideration can also be made on the written plan by reading the models of letters proposed by Perles y Campos and Martínez de Valdepeñas. Finally, we cannot exclude short essential sentences proposed by the author to complete his theoretical explanation in the considered chapter. [25] is the only text among those examined presented entirely in the form of two dialogues, without any real division into chapters based on the parts of the speech or on any other logical classification. In this case, the glosses are a fundamental help for the reader, which helps \"splitting\" the dialogue based on the topics covered in each \"split\". Another peculiarity is that dialogues written by Massimo Troiano alternate with annotations introduced by Argisto Giuffredi. In some cases, these annotations are real corrections of the concepts expressed in the dialogue; in other cases, they include Giuffredi's opinions or reasoning on the subject; sometimes they offer a useful hint to the reader to improve its level of knowledge of both the Italian and Spanish languages.","refs":[{"start":842,"end":846,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b26"}]}]},{"title":"The challenges of each book 2.3.1.

Therefore, the database has specific qualitative features (that match the definition of macro and micro-structure) which can be extended, linked and related, once again, to multiple contexts and choices (for example, other bilingual teaching grammar of different languages, not only Spanish).

This means that the elements that define micro and macro-structure of books and grammars must be encapsulated in data structures that will allow us to faithfully represent the original text, but also define a common schema to support comparison between very different structures. Some of these problems have been presented in this work: the definition of chapters, sections and topics even when the original author does not use them, or use them in so many different ways that each grammar is apparently a whole different format. But as we can easily imagine, this is not completely true: some topics may vary, but others are just presented in different forms. While this macro-observation is easy to do with and analogical approach, others (like different translations, different approaches to some grammatical explanations or different use of verbs or adjectives) can be very costly without a machine-assisted approach.","refs":[]},{"text":"Our efforts are now directed towards the building of a first demo of our database with a subset of all the data we need to analyze. This means that we have defined the data we want to extract from each grammar and how to link it (as shown in our ER schema) and we have already parsed a wide portion of our corpus. To meet our goal we need to keep working in both these directions: parsing the remaining texts on one hand; convert our schemes and designs into a proper-functional database on the other.","refs":[]}]}],"tables":{"tab_1":{"heading":"Table 1","description":"Summary of macro-structure elements in the corpus.","rows":[["Author","Parts of speech Dialogs Lexicon Proverbs Letters Glosses"],["Mario Alessandri d'Urbino (1560)","x","","",""],["Mattia Chirchmair (1709)","x","x","x","x"],["Antonio Fabro (1627)","x","x","x","x"],["Lorenzo Franciosini (1624)","x","","","","x"],["José Martínez de Valdepeñas (1786)","x","x","","","x"],["Giovanni Miranda (1566)","x","","","","x"],["Josef Faustino Perles y Campos (1689)","x","","x","x","x"],["Gennaro Sisti (1742)","x","x","x",""],["Massimo Troiano (1601)","x","","","","x","x"]]}},"abstract":{"title":"Abstract","paragraphs":[{"text":"In this paper, we will discuss the design of a database for the diachronic study of the production of grammars (grammarography) for the teaching of Spanish to an Italian-speaking audience between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries. We will focus on the grammarography of the Spanish language as second language (the so-called Gramáticas de Español para Italianos, henceforth GEI). The aim of this database is to provide a common ground for the researchers in this field to establish the definition of the grammaticographical textual genre of GEI. The database will allow a more in-depth analysis of each work, facilitating through a graphical interface the recognition of their common and uncommon features.","refs":[]}]}}
