Digital libraries are heterogeneous systems with functionalities that range from data representation to data exchange and data management.

For this reason, some of the concepts modelled by the DELOS Reference Model are not explicitly modelled by the 5S model.

The services are conceived and developed to be applicable to a wide variety of cultural collections. The potential generality of the environment is demonstrated by the fact that CULTURA is supporting different use cases that are represented by the Imaginum Patavinae Scientiae Archivum (IPSA) and 1641 collections, which differ in morphology, language, modality and metadata. This means that the environment and the supported services need to consider the peculiarities of different documents and different ways of making use of them by diverse categories of users. One of the supported services which must be conceived and made available, taking into specific account the peculiarities of the documents of different collections, is the annotation service [3]. Almost everybody is familiar with annotations and has his own intuitive idea about what they are, drawn from personal experience and the habit of dealing with some kind of annotation in everyday life, which ranges from jottings for the shopping to taking notes during a lecture or even adding a commentary to a text. This intuitiveness makes annotations especially appealing for both researchers and users: the former propose annotations as an easily understandable way of performing user tasks, while the latter feel annotations to be a familiar tool for carrying out their own tasks. Therefore, annotations have been adopted in a variety of different contexts, such as content enrichment, data curation, collaborative and learning applications, and social networks, as well as in various information management systems, such as the Web (semantic and not), digital libraries, and databases.","refs":[{"start":1010,"end":1013,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b2"}]},{"text":"The role of annotations in digital humanities is well known and documented [2,5,7]. Subsequently, many different tools which allow for the annotation of digital humanities content have been developed. Unfortunately, tools designed specifically for an individual portal are typically only compatible with that system. More general solutions, which can be easily distributed across various sites, have been developed, but these systems often have limited functionality (only annotating a single content type, no sharing features etc.). FAST-CAT (Flexible Annotation Semantic Tool -Content Annotation Tool) is a generic annotation system that directly addresses this challenge by providing a convenient and powerful means of annotating digital content. Figure 2 shows an example of an annotation supported by the CULTURA environment. According to this model, an annotation is a compound multimedia object which is constituted by different signs of annotation. Each sign materializes part of the annotation itself; for example, we can have textual signs, which contain the textual content of the annotation, image signs, if the annotation is made up of images, and so on. In turn, each sign is characterized by one or more meanings of annotation, which specify the semantics of the sign; for example, we can have a sign whose meaning corresponds to the title field in the Dublin Core (DC) metadata schema, in the case of a metadata annotation, or we can have a sign carrying a question of the authors about a document whose meaning may be \"question\" or similar. An annotation has a scope which defines its visibility (public, shared, or private), and can be shared with different groups of users. Public annotations can be read by everyone and modified only by their owner; shared annotations can be modified by their owner and accessed by the specified list of groups with the given access permissions, e.g., read only or read/write; private annotations can be read and modified only by their owner.

Consequently, a possibly standardized methodology for designing linguistic databases is necessary to develop linguistic resources that fully meet the desiderata of The FLaReNet Strategic Agenda which presented a set of recommendations for the development and progress of LRs in Europe [24].","refs":[{"start":716,"end":720,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b23"}]},{"text":"One of the basic problems we have to deal with when setting up a database with linguistic data is related to the qualitatively and quantitatively different types of data that have to be classified and retrieved. A linguistic database with the function of the old linguistic atlases (and hopefully many more) contains in addition to the obvious linguistic data also many other kinds of data among those information about geographic locations, the type of inquiries adopted to gather the data, the speakers who have delivered the data, all of them being relevant to the linguistic analysis and therefore to be made accessible to the user. The ASIt (Syntactic Atlas of Italy) linguistic project builds on a long standing tradition of collecting and analyzing linguistic corpora, which has given rise to different studies and projects over the years [1,[10][11][12]. Research on the syntax of Italian is of great interest to several important lines of research in linguistics: it allows comparison between closely related varieties (the dialects), hence the formation of hypotheses about the nature of cross-linguistic parametrization; it allows contact phenomena between Romance and Germanic varieties to be singled out, in those areas where Germanic dialects are spoken; it allows syntactic phenomena of Romance and Germanic dialects to be found, described and analyzed to a great level of detail [10]. The conceptual model of ASIt is depicted in Fig. 3.","refs":[{"start":846,"end":849,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b0"},{"start":849,"end":853,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b9"},{"start":853,"end":857,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b10"},{"start":857,"end":861,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b11"},{"start":1395,"end":1399,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b9"},{"start":1450,"end":1451,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_2"}]},{"text":"The ASIt Digital Library System was originally intended to support the first line of research, i.e. comparison between closely related Italian varieties [1].

This was a crucial methodological investment to support the other lines of research, specifically those involving the relationship between Romance and Germanic varieties and investigated in a multidisciplinary and collaborative project, \"Cimbrian as a test case for synchronic and diachronic language variation\" [10].","refs":[{"start":153,"end":156,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b0"},{"start":694,"end":698,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b9"}]},{"text":"Exposing linguistic data as Linked Open Data enhances the interoperability between existing linguistic datasets and allows for their integration with other resources that use a Resource Description Framework (RDF) approach such as lexical-semantic resources already available as Linked Data, e.g. a general knowledge base like DBpedia1 , or linguistic resources like WordNet2 or Wiktionary3 . In order to make ASIt re-usable and interoperable, we defined the ASIt Linguistic Linked Dataset based on the conceptual schema of the curated database [14]. In Fig. 4 we report the main classes and properties defining the RDF schema. The generalizability of the ASIt approach that is materialized in the developed conceptual schema has been shown in a recent test case [11]: the DFG-Projekt PO 1642/1-1. 4 The objective of this project is the synchronic and diachronic analysis of the syntax of Italian and Portuguese relative clauses. Since the project aimed at investigating a set of phenomena related to different types of relative clauses, syntactic phenomena under investigation are captured through a new dedicated sentence level tag set tailored for this project. This database is the first attempt to investigate different types of relative clauses in a corpus of spoken colloquial language in a systematic way. The challenge consisted in adapting the tools of the ASIt project to the corpus data, i.e. adapting a design originally created to deal with a purely experimental setting to a much freer and less controlled set of data coming from a pre-existing corpus.","refs":[{"start":334,"end":335,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_0"},{"start":374,"end":375,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_1"},{"start":389,"end":390,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_2"},{"start":545,"end":549,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b13"},{"start":559,"end":560,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_3"},{"start":763,"end":767,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b10"},{"start":798,"end":799,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_3"}]}]},{"title":"Scientific Data: The LoD DIRECT System","paragraphs":[{"text":"The importance of research data is widely recognized across all scientific fields as this data constitutes a fundamental building block of science.
