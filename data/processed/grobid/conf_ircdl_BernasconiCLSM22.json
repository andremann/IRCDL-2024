A lot of the videos uploaded on Youtube have licenses that prohibit reuse; hence they cannot be used for our purpose of building a trailer. Therefore, we implemented another filter for retrieving only videos with the Youtube Creative Common license that allows for commercial use. Nevertheless, we can search and retrieve many videos that fit within the search parameters. The gathered video content and related metadata will be used in the last step to compose the draft of a trailer for the book.","refs":[]}]},{"title":"Image Extraction and Processing","paragraphs":[{"text":"Another fundamental step in the pipeline of Storybook is to extract images from the PDF files of the books (line 10 of Algorithm 1).","refs":[]},{"text":"Difficulties arise from the fact that many book publishers compress the PDF, hence losing the information related to the images. Thus, it is necessary for the algorithm first to detect whether the PDF file was compressed or not. This detection can be done by looking into the metadata and searching for the compressor's sign (often, it leaves a signature). As a result, we can separate the compressed PDF to pass through an OCR process that includes rebuilding the images as well; the one we found most efficient was the Adobe Acrobat one 3 .","refs":[{"start":539,"end":540,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_2"}]},{"text":"Subsequently, whether the PDF was not compressed or had been rebuilt from the OCR, the next step was to understand the color space in which the image is stored inside the PDF. In some rare cases, it is not possible to rebuild the color space, so it is impossible without analyzing the image to know if a 0 means a white or black pixel 4 . In these cases, we extract both versions of the image.","refs":[{"start":335,"end":336,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_3"}]},{"text":"Finally, we select the 𝑘 best images of the book.

In order to speed up the development, instead of implementing a custom image classification, we went for using an external service, Google Vision AI 5 . For each image, we retrieve up to 𝑜 labels, along with their confidence level.

The score increases when there is a match between the image's labels and the video's metadata, such as the description. The confidence of the image-keywords association gives a score's weight (as assigned during the classification step). Once each video has a score, the algorithm matches the highest score per single image, associates that video with the specific image, and discards all the others. Afterwards, the trailer is generated by interleaving the extracted images, and their correspondent retrieved videos. This draft of the trailer is generated for compatibility reasons as an annotated PowerPoint presentation, thus allowing the curator to manipulate the content as they see fit before the actual video creation. Furthermore, all the data generated along the pipeline is packaged inside a JSON file that the curator can access to check the intermediates results and other details on the process.","refs":[]}]},{"title":"Early evaluation","paragraphs":[{"text":"The system was designed and implemented based on requirements iteratively refined with a team of curators of a publishing house.

From a high-level perspective, the main novelty of the approach is that it supports the creation process while not replacing the human contribution and final choice. An early evaluation shows that expert users appreciate this aspect and react positively to how relevant videos are collected. A potential limiting factor has been found in the limited availability of online videos on niche topics, significantly restricting the search to videos with licenses that allow unrestricted reuse. For the future, we have planned a formal evaluation of the system with a larger sample of users and the integration of Storybook into the Arca system mentioned in section 3.1.","refs":[]}]}],"tables":{"tab_0":{"heading":"17 end for 18 return 𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑑𝑉 𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑜𝑠","description":"web services offering video search capability.

Storybook supports an expert by gathering relevant crowd-sourced multimedia content, which, arranged as stories, can be used to showcase a book in the form of video clips. Crucially, the expert controls how the content is finally combined and edited rather than offering a fully automated process.
