main aim for search engines is to offer a satisfying user experience. Their success can be measured by how well they are able to predict user actions and provide users with the right content at the right time. Modelling user behaviour accurately also allows search engines to adapt their user interface design to match users' needs. This includes deciding where each user interface component should be placed and which content should be provided to the user. However, problems arise when improving platforms such as digital libraries (e.g., academic search engines) that aim to provide personalised content to their user-base, namely researchers and students. In fact, it is often not possible to build personalised user models due to the lack of sufficient daily user interactions in comparison to web search engines [1], and even when available, such models would be generated at a significantly smaller scale and would be less accurate.","refs":[{"start":822,"end":825,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b0"}]},{"text":"Recently, user behaviour has been subject to controversy debates in information security and privacy related areas, especially with the large portion of collected user data in web search engines and digital libraries.

The exploratory group of users generate longer sessions, thus higher total of state transitions which results in a diverse number of simulated sessions. Using search types to discover context helped creating simulated sessions more similar to original ones (i.e., reducing the accuracy of the classifier). In addition, table 3a also reports low precision (i.e., 0.573 for known-item and 0.636 for exploratory)/recall (i.e., 0.487 for known-item and 0.527 for exploratory) values along with a low accuracy score (i.e., 0.564 for known-item and 0.608 for exploratory) when using the exploratory-known-item approach in comparison to the baseline, which indicates that we can have better confidence in the results.","refs":[{"start":1007,"end":1008,"marker":"table","target":null}]}]},{"title":"Approach","paragraphs":[{"text":"Our initial hypothesis was that the baseline model should outperform the time-aware Markov model since the baseline is less complex to learn (e.g., excluding dwell time features). The less information needed to encode in the model the easier it is to get \"similar\" simulated data. However, adding time improves our model's simulation quality as we gained around 2.67%/1.21% in term of the relative improvement over the baseline. Another hypothesis that we have tested is to replace the estimated time distribution between actions using gamma distribution with a calculated average of dwell time of the same state transition and feed it as a feature to the model [43]. We concluded that the gamma estimation scored much better than averaging the dwell time value.","refs":[{"start":662,"end":666,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b42"}]},{"text":"Although these results do not undoubtfully prove that we succeeded in simulating look-alike user search sessions, they show that users in our simulated sessions behave in a way that comes closer to the original behaviour from the log data.","refs":[]}]},{"title":"Conclusion","paragraphs":[{"text":"In this paper we have presented various variants of Markov model-based simulation techniques that simulate global and user-type specific behaviour models. In our approaches, we first introduced a formal baseline that consists of exploring a first-order Markov model which we argue to be the best fit for our dataset. Then we extended the work of Baeza-Yates et al. [20] and presented a conditional Markov approach that is adapted for simulation modeling. Next, we initiated the problem of learning contextual Markov models where we partitioned users according to their navigation behaviour. In particular, we grouped users by learning a mixture of search characteristics that categorise them into exploratory search and known-item search types. Then we explored the work of Huang et al. [29] and adopted user's session-level query change to develop a syntactic Markov model that models the syntactic change which occurs between two consecutive queries. Finally, in our time-aware approach, we modeled the dwell time that users spend in between actions using the gamma distribution and then fed it as a feature to our evaluation model. There are several straightforward extensions to our work. We can use better clustering techniques for context discovery in contextual Markov models. Another extension is to model the duration of state transition differently.","refs":[{"start":365,"end":369,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b19"},{"start":787,"end":791,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b28"}]},{"text":"We performed experiments on a real-wold dataset with conditional, contextual, time-aware and query-change Markov models and provided more empirical results showing that our Markov approaches succeeded in simulating sessions that are deemed to be good approximations of actual user sessions, making our Markov models approaches a suitable choice for user session simulation.","refs":[]}]}],"tables":{"tab_0":{"heading":"Table 1","description":"Two Sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test of log sessions and simulated sessions distributions using different Markov model approaches.

An efficient search user interface design requires a detailed understanding of user behaviour to match their needs. A common approach to modelling users is to transform the recorded users' navigation behaviour to Markov models and analyse them to provide personalised content. However, personalisation based on log data is hard to achieve due to the lack of sufficient daily user interactions in comparison to web search engines, even when achieved, it's usually on the cost of users' privacy and the confidentiality of their personal information potentially leading to privacy violation. In order to allow data analysis while retaining users' privacy, we propose a Markov approach to simulate user sessions and help reducing the amount of collected user data while preserving the profiling efficiency. Specifically, given log data of search sequences performed by users in a digital library, we explore basic, conditional, contextual, time-aware and query-change Markov models to simulate similar search sequences. Our results on an academic search engine log dataset show that our methods reliably simulate global and type specific search behaviour. Simulated search sequences representing an approximation of real behaviour can be used to generate log data at any desired volume and variety such that A/B-testing digital libraries becomes scalable.","refs":[]}]}}
