These functionalities return a ranked list of the resources included in the DLs. No semantic relation among the returned objects is usually reported that could help the user to obtain a more complete knowledge on the subject of the search. For example, consider as user a young woman wishing to know more about Dante Alighieri, the major Italian poet of the late Middle Ages. She may ask \"Dante Alighieri\" to a Web search engine and most likely she would get a list of ranked documents with the Wikipedia page about Dante within the top 5 results. Not willing to spend her time reading, the user tries other Web sites, where she hopes to find something quicker to consume than the typical textbook narrative. At some point, she tries to search on the Web page of a DL, e.g. Europeana 1 . However, the result is a list of objects without any explicit semantic relations to each other. Each object offers a single view of Dante's life and works, but altogether incapable of providing an complete overview of Dante's life. This behavior, which generally characterizes DLs, is a consequence of seeing a digital library as a traditional library endowed with digital resources managed by software. The introduction of the Semantic Web [5], and in particular of the Linked Open Data2 , has the potential of improving the search functionalities of DLs. In this context, the long-term aim of our study has been to introduce the narrative as new first-class search functionality of DLs. As output of a query, the envisaged new search functionality should not only return a list of objects but it should also present one or more narratives, composed of events that are linked to the objects of the existing libraries and are endowed with a set of semantic relations connecting these events into a meaningful semantic network. As a necessary and preliminary step towards this direction, this paper presents an overview of the main developed ontologies for formally representing events, along with several tools for their construction and visualization in user-friendly forms, based on semantic models. Indeed, in order to introduce this new search functionality for DLs, we aim at developing: (i) a formal ontology for representing events and narratives, which reuses existing ontologies in order to maximize its interoperability; (ii) a tool that allows users to construct narratives but also to visualize them in an easy and useful way.
