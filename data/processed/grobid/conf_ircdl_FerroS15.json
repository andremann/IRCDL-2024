Therefore, to exchange user profiles, two different DL systems, one built using the 5S model and the other built using the DELOS Reference model, would need, at the best, a set of (hard-coded) rules instructing them to translate their internal notion of society/actor into the Agent class.

This latter aspect was also part of the original 5S model vision, which aimed at automatically instantiating and deploying a DL system from a catalog of components corresponding to the notions introduced in the model [15]; unfortunately, this vision has not been fully embodied yet, especially in wide settings, but the last decade of efforts geared towards interoperability and the today pervasiveness of semantic Web technologies may offer the opportunity of performing the next step in this direction.","refs":[{"start":900,"end":904,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b14"}]},{"text":"The paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 briefly summarizes the main DL models, as the 5S and DELOS Reference model are; Sect. 3 describes the details of a relevant sub-domain of those models, i.e. the quality domain; Sect. 4 provides an example of the approach discussed above in the case of the quality domain; Sect. 5 draws some final remarks.","refs":[]}]},{"title":"Models for Digital Libraries","paragraphs":[]},{"title":"5S Model","paragraphs":[{"text":"The 5S [12,16,17] is a formal model which draws upon the broad digital library literature to produce a comprehensive base of support.

A Quality Parameter is evaluated by a Measurement, is measured by a Measure assigned according to the Measurement, and expresses the assessment of an Actor. With respect to the definition provided by ISO, we can note that: the \"set of inherent characteristics\" corresponds to the pair (Resource, Quality Parameter); the \"degree of fulfillment\" fits in with the pair (Measurement, Measure); finally, the \"requirements\" are taken into consideration by the assessment expressed by an Actor. A Resource is any identifiable entity in the DL universe and resembles the concept of resource used in the Web [32]. In addition to this general concept, the Resource in the DELOS Reference Model has some additional features: it can be arranged or set out according to a resource format which, for example, allows a Resource to be composed of or linked to other Resources; it can be characterised by various Quality Parameters, each capturing how the Resource performs with respect to some attribute; it is regulated by policies governing every aspect of its lifetime; it is expressed by an information object; and, it can be described by or commented on by an information object, especially by metadata and annotations. An Actor is someone or something which interacts with the DL universe, being it a human being or a computing device. An Actor is a Resource and inherits all its key characteristics, even if they are specialized to better fit to the notion of Actor. For example, the policies represent the functions that Actors can perform or the information objects they have access to.","refs":[{"start":730,"end":734,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b31"}]},{"text":"Quality Parameters serve the purpose of expressing the different facets of the quality domain. In this model, each Quality Parameter is itself a Resource and inherits all its characteristics, as, for example, the property of having a unique identifier. Quality Parameters provide information about how, and how well, a Resource performs with respect to some viewpoint and resemble the notion of quality dimension in [5]. They express the assessment of an Actor about the Resource under examination. They can be evaluated according to different Measurements, which provide alternative procedures for assessing different aspects of a Quality Parameter and assigning it a value, i.e. a Measure. Being a Resource, a Quality Parameter can be organised in arbitrarily complex and structured forms because of the composition and linking facilities, e.g. a Quality Parameter can be the compound of smaller Quality Parameters each capturing a specific aspect of the whole or it can be itself characterised and affected by various Quality Parameters. For example, Availability is affected by Robustness and Fault Management: in fact, when a function is both robust and able to recover from error conditions, it is probable that its availability is also increased. A Quality Parameter can be regulated or affected by policies. For example, the Economic Convenience of accessing a DL may be affected by its charging policy, since the latter is responsible for the definition of the charging strategies adopted by the DL. Finally, a Quality Parameter can be enriched with metadata and annotations. In particular, the former can provide useful information about the provenance of a Quality Parameter, while the latter can offer the possibility to add comments about a Quality Parameter, interpreting the obtained values, and proposing actions to improve it. In order to clarify the relationship between Quality Parameter, Measurement and Measure, we can take an example from the information retrieval field. One of the main Quality Parameters in relation to an information retrieval system is its effectiveness, meant as its capability to answer user information needs with relevant items. This Quality Parameter can be evaluated according to many different Measurements, such as precision and recall [27]: precision evaluates effectiveness in the sense of the ability of the system to reject useless items, while recall evaluates effectiveness in the sense of the ability of the system to retrieve useful items. The actual values for precision and recall are Measures and are usually computed using standard tools, such as trec eval7 , which are Actors, but in this case not human. Quality Parameters are specialized and grouped according to the Resource under examination as follows:","refs":[{"start":416,"end":419,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b4"},{"start":2287,"end":2291,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b26"},{"start":2619,"end":2620,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_0"}]},{"text":"- It is important to note that the grouping described above is made from the perspective of the Resource under examination, i.e., the object under assessment. In any case, the Actor, meant as the active subject who expresses the assessment and knows the requirements a Resource is expected to fulfill, is always taken into consideration and explicitly modelled, since he is an integral part of the definition of Quality Parameter. For example, the User Satisfaction parameter is put in the Functionality Quality Parameter group because it expresses how much an Actor (the subject who makes the assessment) is satisfied when he uses a given function (the object of the assessment). On the other hand, in the case of the User Behaviour parameter, the object of the assessment is an Actor together with his way of behaving with respect to some policy, while the subject who is making the assessment is another Actor, for example, an administrator; for this reason, this parameter is put in the User Quality Parameter group.

They could also be based on processing and comparing measurements between a reference sample and the actual sample obtained by the system.
