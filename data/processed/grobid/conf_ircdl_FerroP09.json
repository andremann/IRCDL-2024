However, after three years within TREC, it was decided that Europe was better suited for the coordination of an activity that focused on multilingual aspects of information retrieval.

The goal has been not only to meet but also to anticipate the emerging needs of the R&D community and to encourage the development of next generation multilingual IR systems. This has meant that the number of tracks offered by CLEF has increased over the years, from just two in 2000 to nine separate tracks in 2008.

As can be seen from Table 1, the different ad-hoc tasks present varying degrees of difficulty: there are more basic tasks, such as the monolingual tasks or the bilingual English tasks,  designed to encourage inexperienced groups to experiment and increase their knowhow; there are intermediate tasks, such as the bilingual task with unusual pair of languages, where groups can try to apply more advanced techniques or experiment their own consolidated techniques in a more challenging scenario; finally, there are advanced tasks, such as the multilingual and robust tasks, where groups have to address difficult issues and discover innovative solutions. In this way, over the years, we have offered different entry points to the fields of CLIR and MLIA in order to support the creation and growth of a research community with diversified expertise. The results have been considerable; it is probably true to say that this track has done much to foster the creation of a strong European research community in the CLIR area. It has provided the resources, the test collections and also the forum for discussion and comparison of ideas and results. Groups submitting experiments over several years have shown flexibility in advancing to more complex tasks, from monolingual to bilingual and multilingual experiments. Much work has been done on fine-tuning for individual languages while other efforts have concentrated on developing language-independent strategies.","refs":[{"start":230,"end":231,"marker":"table","target":"#tab_0"}]},{"text":"There is also substantial proof of significant increase in retrieval effectiveness in multilingual settings by the systems of CLEF participants. [3] provides a comparison between effectiveness scores from the 1997 TREC-6 campaign and the CLEF 2003 campaign in which retrieval tasks were offered for eight European languages. While in 1997 systems were performing at about 50%-60% of monolingual effectiveness for multilingual settings, that figure had risen to 80%-85% by 2003 for languages that had been part of multiple evaluation campaigns. In the recent campaigns, we commonly see a figure of about 85%-90% for most languages.","refs":[{"start":145,"end":148,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b2"}]},{"text":"In 2008 there was a big change in focus in this track and we started to move from a breadth-wise exploration of the CLIR field to a deeper investigation of each specific area with the objective of acquiring a more profound understanding of the basic mechanisms. To this end, we introduced very different document collections, a non-European target language, and an Information Retrieval (IR) task designed to attract participation from groups interested in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The track was thus structured in three distinct streams.","refs":[]},{"text":"The first task offered monolingual and cross-language search on library catalog records. It was organized in collaboration with The European Library (TEL)8 and used three collections from the catalogs of the British Library, the Biblioth√©que Nationale de France and the Austrian National Library. The underlying aim was to identify the most effective retrieval technologies for searching this type of very sparse multilingual data. In fact, the collections contained catalog records in many languages in addition to English, French or German. The task presumed a user with a working knowledge of these three languages who wants to find documents that can be useful for them in one of the three target catalogs. Records in other languages were counted irrelevant.","refs":[{"start":154,"end":155,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_7"}]},{"text":"The TEL task is an example of how the ad-hoc track has started to explore finer-grained questions in the CLIR scenario. Indeed the sparsity of the data and their intrinsic multilingualigy are particularly challenging from a retrieval point of view, since the catalog records have to be suitably processed and expanded and the intrinsic multilinguality of the collection has to be catered for with techniques that go beyond the traditional fusion strategies adopted in previous multilingual tasks. It is not expected that new language resources or linguistic tools will be produced in this task but rather that already existing ones will be exploited. The TEL task represents an example of a task that focuses more on retrieval issues than on language or linguistic aspects and is further evidence that crosslanguage information retrieval is much more than simple machine translation plus information retrieval. Exploiting the CLIR acronym, we could say that it is a CLIR task, meaning that it stresses the importance of the retrieval techniques in a multilingual setting.","refs":[]},{"text":"The Persian@CLEF activity was coordinated in collaboration with the Database Research Group (DBRG) of Tehran University. It was the first time that CLEF offered a non-European language target collection. We chose Persian for several reasons: its challenging script (a modified version of the Arabic alphabet with elision of short vowels) written from right to left; its complex morphology (extensive use of suffixes and compounding); its political and cultural impor-tance. This task focuses on the creation of new experimental collections to develop both new linguistic resources (lexicons, dictionaries, and so on) and new linguistic components (stop lists, stemmers, part of speech taggers, and so on). From a retrieval point of view, the necessary techniques are well-known and it is not expected that participants produce new IR components. In this case, we could say that this is a CLIR task.","refs":[]},{"text":"The robust task ran for the third time at CLEF 2008. This year it used English test data from previous campaigns but, in addition to the original documents and topics, the organizers provided Word Sense Disambiguated (WSD) documents and topics. Both monolingual and bilingual experiments (topics in Spanish) were activated. This task focuses on the benefits that a deeper and more sophisticated linguistic analysis can produce in a multilingual setting, especially when hard topics are being handled and the aim is to achieve robust performances across the set of topics. As in the previous case, it is not expected that participants produce new IR components. On the other hand, the development and adoption of word sense disambiguation algorithms and their introduction into a consolidated retrieval pipeline puts attention on the linguistic part of the process. Again, In this case, we define this as a CLIR task.","refs":[]},{"text":"This deeper investigation will be taken a step further in the Grid@CLEF Pilot task9 which has been proposed for CLEF 2009 with the following goals in mind [4]:","refs":[{"start":82,"end":83,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_8"},{"start":155,"end":158,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b3"}]},{"text":"to look at differences across a wide set of languages; -to identify best practices for each language; -to help other countries to develop their expertise in the IR field and create IR groups.","refs":[]},{"text":"Indeed, individual researchers or small groups do not usually have the possibility of running large-scale and systematic experiments over a large set of experimental collections and resources. It is our hypothesis that a series of systematic grid experiments can re-use and exploit the valuable resources and experimental collections made available by CLEF in order to gain more insights about the effectiveness of, for example, the various weighting schemes and retrieval techniques with respect to the languages. This knowledge could then be disseminated to both the research and the application communities.","refs":[]},{"text":"In order to run these grid experiments, we need to set up a framework in which participants can exchange the intermediate output of the components of their systems and create a run by using the output of the components of other participants. For example, if the expertise of participant A is in building stemmers and decompounders while participant B's expertise is in developing probabilistic IR models, we would like to make it possible for participant A to apply his stemmer to a document collection, pass the output to participant B, who tests his probabilistic IR model, thus obtaining a final run which represents the result of testing participant A stemmer + participant B probabilistic IR model.","refs":[]},{"text":"The Pilot Grid task in CLEF 2009 will provide a framework for a first set of experiments which will allow us to start to explore the interaction among IR components and languages.
