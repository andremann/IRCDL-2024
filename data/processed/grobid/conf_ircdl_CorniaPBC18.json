In particular, starting from a classical convolutional neural network, it iteratively refines saliency predictions by incorporating an attentive mechanism. Also, it is able to reproduce the center bias present in human eye fixations by exploiting a set of prior maps directly learned from data. Overall, the performance achieved by the selected saliency method allows us to rely on saliency maps that effectively reproduce the human attention on natural images.","refs":[{"start":99,"end":103,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b11"}]}]},{"title":"Experimental Evaluation","paragraphs":[{"text":"In this section, we briefly describe datasets and metrics used to evaluate our solution and provide quantitative and qualitative comparisons with other image cropping methods.","refs":[]}]},{"title":"Datasets","paragraphs":[{"text":"To validate the effectiveness of visual saliency in the automatic image cropping task, we perform experiments on two different publicly available datasets.","refs":[]},{"text":"The Flickr-Cropping dataset [6] is composed of 1,743 images, each of them associated to ground-truth cropping parameters.

The first one aims at maximizing the difference of the averaged saliency between the selected bounding box and the outer region of the image. For simplicity, we set the size of search window to each scale among [0.75, 0.80, . . . , 0.95] of the original image and slide search window over a 10 × 10 uniform grid. The VGG Activations is, instead, the proposed image cropping method where the saliency maps are replaced with the activations of the last convolutional layer of the VGG-16 network [25].
