Scholarly record is taken to mean the aggregation of scientific journals, gray literature and conference presentations plus the underlying data and other evidence to support the published findings. At present, this record is poorly connected and this constitutes a major obstacle to a full engagement by scholars who need to be able to move from paper to paper, from hypotheses to evidence, or between paper and underlying data efficiently. Modern science requires the establishment of a linked scholarly record in order to effectively support scholarly inquiry.","refs":[]}]},{"title":"The Changing Scenario of the Scholarly Record","paragraphs":[{"text":"We have identified the following main transformations that depend on linking technologies.","refs":[]}]},{"title":"Scientific literature is becoming increasingly network-centric: Linked Scientific Literature Spaces","paragraphs":[{"text":"We foresee that future scientific literature will be increasingly network-centric.

An important consequence of the creation of linked literature spaces is that information seeking becomes a horizontal rather than a vertical form of behavior.

In a data-dominated science, there are rapidlyexpanding demands of \"data-everywhere\" The most acute challenge stems from research teams relying on a large number of diverse and interrelated datasets but having no way to manage their scientific data spaces in a principled fashion. Therefore, there is a need for mechanisms and approaches that allow the linking of datasets produced by diverse research teams. Linking a dataset refers to the capability of linking it to other external datasets, and in turn being linked from external datasets. A generalization of the linking data concept leads to the creation of linked scientific data spaces of disciplinary or interdisciplinary scope. The concept of scientific data spaces responds to the increasing demands by researchers for data-everywhere.

In fact, advanced information technologies have led to the generation of very large volumes of linguistic data, i.e. text and speech corpora, dictionaries, lexicons, language descriptions, etc. The challenge is now to interlink this wealth of data accumulated in more than half a century of computational linguistics, of empirical, corpus-based study of language and of computational lexicography in all its heterogeneity. By linking this data, automated analyses of literary works can be carried out much more effectively.

Scientific communication across disciplinary boundaries needs semantic enhancements to make the text intelligible to a broad audience composed of specialists in different scientific disciplines. This need motivated the current development of semantic publishing. Semantic publishing is taken to mean the enhancement of the meaning of an online research article by automatically disambiguating and semantically defining specialist terms. This can be achieved by linking to discipline-specific ontologies and standard terminology repositories, by linking to other information sources of relevance to the article, and by direct linking to all of the article's cited references. An additional semantic enhancement can be obtained by intelligently linking a scientific text to third-party commentaries, archived talks and Web sites.","refs":[]},{"text":"Ontologies are also considered as a suitable formal tool for sophisticated data access.
