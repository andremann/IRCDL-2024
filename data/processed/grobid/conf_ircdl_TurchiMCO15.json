With faster computers and more direct access storage it became possible to search the document's full text: relevance was then determined by the number of occurrences of each search term in the document, for example in relation to document size. The first search engines on the Web used this approach.","refs":[]},{"text":"However, search term occurrences are not a good indicator for relevance: for example, when trying to find information on \"VW Golf\" search engines directed the user to online advertisements for used cars as these had the keywords, combined with a high occurrence to length ratio. Google's PageRank algorithm saved the day: now the number of links to a site determined relevance, higher if the sites with the links also had a high ranking. Then the \"VW Golf\" query would direct the user to an official site for Volkswagen, which most users would find more relevant than the car-for-sale advertisements.","refs":[]},{"text":"While the PageRank algorithm functions well and offers a notion of \"relevance\" that is shared by many users it has the disadvantage of being static. It may be enhanced by other data and other techniques, but is in principle based on the current structure of the Web. The algorithm will even freeze this picture, as the high ranking will make the important sites more important.

After some effort, trying a site here, another there, we have found what we have been looking for. To indicate that this site is interesting we could use a feature recently introduced by Google, the +11 service. However, it will also be possible to extract the \"interesting site\" information indirectly, for example by evaluating the time used on each site, how many links on the site that were explored, if the user printed anything from the site or if the \"buy\" button was clicked.

The idea is taken from biology, from the way ants forage for food: the image in itself refers also to the seminal work of Norbert Wiener, the pioneer both of Cybernetics and of the political approach to technology. Particularly in [31], Wiener uses the figurative speech of ants as a dystopian one. Ants are perceived as a meek colony instead of an unpredictable cluster of single ants, each with its own identity.

But, at the same time, it is important not to undervalue the possible risks in a collaborative approach. Any single \"ant\" (i.e. any user ) has his own unique and value-added perspective and knowledge, and should then be helped to enhance his sense of awareness about his \"singularity\". Seen under contemporary eyes, \"ants\" can easily be exploited by a single-minded, marketoriented society, or by a too generalist and massive search engine and ranking algorithm. Instead, it is time to break monopolistic ways to access the Web. The information need of any single user must be taken into consideration, interpreted, and fulfilled. To that aim, it is necessary to make use of different methodologies of analysis.
