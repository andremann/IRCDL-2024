Orthography as a word has a background from the Greek words (óρθóζ) and (γρáφ ιν), which means \"correct writing\". Hence, it is deeply connected to the written language. Among the others, it takes care of capitalization, emphasis, hyphenation, punctuation and word breaks style [13]. In this way, it includes all methods and rules of correct writing. Accordingly, it is a sub-part of natural language processing. On the other side, linguistics sees the orthography as the methodology of writing a language. It considers the orthography as a standardization, which is given as a spectrum of conventions, i.e. set of rules. Some languages incorporate non-consistent orthography such as the English language, while the others such as Serbian language have remarkably consistent orthography. In the example of the Serbian language, it means that one letter in the written language has the equivalence of one sound in the spoken language. Also, it is worth noting that any language during a certain historical period has been evolved under different influences. Accordingly, its orthography was changed, too. Sometimes, the orthographic rules were so changed that they have acknowledged the new historical era of the language. In such cases, the differentiation between the orthographic rules can be used to correctly evaluate the historical period of the analyzed document or book. Basically, the differentiation of documents by their orthography can, in many cases, clearly identify documents' dating and printing origin.","refs":[{"start":365,"end":369,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b12"}]},{"text":"In previous works about orthography, authors mainly tried to establish a link between the discrimination of some tokens during the transformation of the language [18] or among different languages [4]. Hence, they used typical linguistic tools like bi-grams, tri-grams, probabilistic mapping and variation in tokens and vocabulary [24]. The main limitation of these works is that they analyze orthography changes in the same language or among different languages. In this study, we overcome this limitation by proposing a new method for orthography discrimination inside the same language and during the evolution of the written language. In this way, we propose a system for recognition of the historical period of the Serbian and Croatian documents according to the use of the orthographic rules present inside the document. In such a context, the document is analyzed and further processed in its digital format, which is essential for the cultural heritage preservation. To the very best of our knowledge, it is the first time that a similar approach has been introduced in the literature. For evaluating the proposed approach, we conduct two quite different experiments: (i) on digitalized printed documents written by angular Glagolitic script dated between XIV and XIX century, which are written in Croatian language, and (ii) on digitalized printed documents written by Cyrillic script dated between XVIII and XIX century, which are written in Slavonic-Serbian and Serbian languages. In the first experiment of the angular Glagolitic script, the writing of the same script is changed, i.e. evolved over time. Hence we are talking about script evolving rules based on the orthography. In the second experiment, the change of the orthography is used as a change of the language and not only of script writing rules. Basically, the transformation of Slavonic-Serbian to modern Serbian language is established by more means: (i) change of the Cyrillic alphabet (differences in letters), (ii) change of language, i.e. rapid evolvement of the language, and (iii) change of the orthographic rules.","refs":[{"start":162,"end":166,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b17"},{"start":196,"end":199,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b3"},{"start":330,"end":334,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b23"}]},{"text":"Printed medieval documents were written in the angular Glagolitic script by the Croatian recension of the Church Slavonic language. Angular Glagolitic was mainly used in the regions along the east, i.e. Croatian side of Adriatic coast. Up to XV century, the holy books were written by hand printing. After inventing printing machine by Gutenberg, the printed books spread over Europe. Up to 1561, the printing offices were opened along Croatian Adriatic coast, i.e. in Senj (from 1491 to 1508) and Rijeka (from 1530 to 1531) [16]. Accordingly, many books were printed by the angular Glagolic script, but using the old orthographic rules [2]. These rules incorporate the writing of capital letters as descendent ones, which is typical for hand printed Glagolitic medieval books. Hence, the use of the old Glagolitic orthography was linked with the printing offices in Rijeka, Senj, Kosinje or Venice, if the editors were Croats. Outside Croatia, the Glagolitic books were mainly printed in Venice, Rome [20], Urach, Tubingen and Prague [3] around and after 1535. However the editors, who were mainly Italians, did not know the old orthography rules. Instead, they used Latin-based orthography in Glagolitic books. This means the use of capital letters as ascending ones. Hence, the change of orthography rules was clearly limited by the historical period before and after 1535.","refs":[{"start":525,"end":529,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b15"},{"start":637,"end":640,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b1"},{"start":1002,"end":1006,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b19"},{"start":1035,"end":1038,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b2"}]},{"text":"Slavonic-Serbian language was the literary language used in Habsburg Empire by the Serbs. In the beginning, the Habsburg Empire tried to assimilate the Serbian population by changing their culture and heritage. Accordingly, it wanted to change the Serbian alphabet from Cyrillic to Latin one. Serbian Church opposed to this change by asking help to Russian Empire. Consequently, in that period, all books, especially liturgical ones, as well as literary, were printed in the Russo-Slavonic language. During the XVIII century, the writers began to blend Russo-Slavonic with Serbian language resulting with a mixed language, which is called Slavonic-Serbian. In 1818, Vuk Stefanović Karadžić with the help of Jernej Kopitar and Sava Mrkalj concluded his book Serbian Dictionary in Vienna. This book was the beginning of reforming the Slavonic-Serbian language with its old orthography according to the widespread modern language of the Serb population. It reformed the Slavonic-Serbian language by Cyrillic alphabet using strict phonemic principles. In this way, the modern Serbian language was distanced from Slavonic-Serbian language in different alphabet and new orthography rules. In the meantime, the last notable work in Slavonic-Serbian was published in 1825 [19].

Linear patterns of codes detected by texture analysis capture the characters disposition. For this reason, extracted features exhibit a discriminant capability.

Furthermore, this mapped text is coded. The coding is performed as follows: (i) the base letter to 0, (ii) the ascender letter to 1, (iii) the descendent letter to 2, and (iv) the full letter to 3 [7,8]. Figure 1(b) shows the coding. In this way, the initial text is coded into a string corresponding to a combination of the set of codes {0, 1, 2, 3}. The final coded text can be seen as an image I(1,j) with the pixel values taken from the set {0, 1, 2, 3}. Figure 1(c) shows the transformation to the image. The given transformation enables the reduction of variables from the number of letters in the alphabet to 4.

Five out of fifteen documents are written in Slavonic-Serbian language, while ten out of fifteen documents are written in modern Serbian language. The documents written in Slavonic-Serbian language are text excerpts from pages of the book entitled Fisika by Atanasije Stojković dated from 1802 [27]. Figure 8(a) shows a sample excerpt from the book Fisika. The rest of the ten documents is a collection of text excerpts from pages of the book Zabavnik dated from 1826 by Vuk Stefanović Karadžić. Figure 8(b) illustrates a sample excerpt from this book. These documents are written in so-called reformed Serbian language, i.e. modern one [26].","refs":[{"start":366,"end":370,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b19"},{"start":370,"end":373,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b20"},{"start":382,"end":386,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_7"},{"start":735,"end":739,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b19"},{"start":869,"end":872,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b2"},{"start":1320,"end":1324,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b26"},{"start":1333,"end":1337,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_8"},{"start":1529,"end":1530,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_8"},{"start":1663,"end":1667,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b25"}]},{"text":"Historical Glagolitic books are available in their digital format at National Library of Zagreb1 .

Different classifiers, i.e. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) [1] and Support Vector Machine (SVM) [12] have also been tested on the databases for solving the classification task. Because Naive Bayes performs considerably better than the other classifiers, it has been definitively adopted in this context. Document feature vectors for each database have been normalized before the classification process.

Evaluation is performed by dividing each database into training and test sets. To make the evaluation process independent from the selected training and test sets, we adopt the K-fold cross validation strategy [14]. Accordingly, performance measures are computed K times, and the average value together with the standard deviation are reported.

In particular, documents in Slavonic-Serbian and Serbian languages are represented by bi-gram and tri-gram frequency vectors [28], on which the same Naive Bayes classifier is employed. Because Glagolitic documents are in the same language but in different script, comparison with bi-grams and tri-grams is not possible. It is a clear limitation of the methods which is overcome by our approach. Table 2 shows the classification results obtained by bi-gram and tri-gram language models. We can observe that our approach outperforms both the competitor methods in terms of f-measure. In fact, bi-gram language model performs poorly in old orthography (Slavonic-Serbian) recognition, with an f-measure of 0.20 in 5-fold and 0.60 in 10-fold. In any case, the f-measure is always below 0.90. On the other hand, tri-gram language model totally misses the old orthography (Slavonic-Serbian) recognition, with an f-measure value of 0 in 5-fold and 0.50 in 10-fold. Also, the f-measure value for new orthography (modern Serbian) recognition is always below 0.85. Again, standard deviation values are pretty high, demonstrating that the methods do not obtain a stable solution.  Finally, our method is computer time non-intensive, taking 1 s for processing a document of 2 K characters. Differently, bi-gram method takes 4 s and tri-gram method takes 5 s on the same document of 2 K characters.
