There are also information and links to the owners, social media channels and the type of open (data) license. By recording this kind of information, the metadata evolve to digital heritage, addressing the Art. Users can interact with digital records by previewing and/or downloading the files together with descriptions. The Preview function shows the strings containing the valued metadata of each cultural entity of the collections and allows access to the resources thanks to query tools. These, through filters corresponding to the labels of the metadata path, are carried out both in terms of content and from a perspective of research of the digital object (Figure 3). In addition, the users can download the dataset in CSV and XLS, as required by the Open Data paradigm. The Institutions section contains information about all the institutions that have played a role in creating both analogic archives and digital collections; even this information are access points for research. This section aims at giving voice to several heterogeneous news, from organized events to the information on the background image of the homepage.","refs":[{"start":352,"end":353,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_0"},{"start":1435,"end":1436,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_2"}]}]},{"title":"Perspectives","paragraphs":[{"text":"The DL Open Memory is ongoing to be implemented more actively for users. The new implementation is creating an intuitive and interactive query interface allowing an increasingly exhaustive search mode that leads the user to land directly on the single digital record from which, through a series of metadata that describes the content, contexts and relationships, it is possible to reach other digital records, rework them and thus create new knowledge and culture.","refs":[]},{"text":"Firstly, to achieve this goal, the interface has been made responsive, i.e. the graphic design responds differently, and it adapts to the device of the user making the implementation more sustainable by being unique for the various devices and systems (there is no specific implementation for web, for mobile, or mobile operating systems such as Android, Apple, etc.).","refs":[]},{"text":"Moreover, the approach for the new front-end is based on Material Design guidelines adopting tools from the field of print design, like baseline grids and structural templates, to have consistency across environments by repeating visual elements, structural grids, and spacing across platforms and screens sizes. These layouts scale to fit any screen size, which simplifies the process of creating scalable apps.","refs":[]},{"text":"A further step will connect datasets with images digitalized coming from each project.

In particular, it is evident that the enhancement of metadata of the digital asset (metadata of content, context, relationships, provenance and life cycle of digital records), according to a dynamic path but compliant with quality and certification requirements, generates an indeterminate range of search keys and an improvement in the methods of access to digital cultural entities and their use.","refs":[]},{"text":"In conclusion, the Open Memory Apulia is proposed as the product of good practices in the use of digital technologies for cultural heritage, pursuing objectives heavily suggested by the European Union, such as the design of digital libraries [25] and the production of Open Data, contributing to the economic and social development policies of the member countries.","refs":[{"start":242,"end":246,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b31"}]}]}],"tables":{},"abstract":{"title":"Abstract","paragraphs":[{"text":"In 2020, the EU proclaimed the need to turn the digitization processes to create and manage records related to the identities of European Communities, transforming data into historical sources of the present time for future generations. In this scenario, the Open Data paradigm plays a decisive role in creating and managing innovative models of digital libraries (DLs). In this paper, we describe the current state-of-the-art of this paradigm, showing how Open Data are essential for communities and discussing the issues that this argument could generate. Afterwards, the research on pilot Open Data DL Open Memory Apulia is presented, focusing on an innovative approach to managing the resources. The digital asset's metadata includes information on digital records' content, their relations with context, and their provenance, according to a dynamic path compliant with quality and certification requirements. The aim is to foster active interaction of users with the collection, linking the datasets enclosed within the DL by relationship metadata.","refs":[]}]}}
