SKOS was born out of the need for standardising a common RDF vocabulary for modelling KOS, following several European projects in the late 1990's and early 2000's, and became a W3C recommendation in 2009 [2]. SKOS is presently one of the most used vocabularies in LOD initiatives, and is extensively reused by other Semantic Web vocabularies. The 'skosification' of controlled vocabularies has enabled their use for Semantic Web applications, such as query expansion, search term recommendations and semantic search engines [13,15,19]. A notable example is The Getty Vocabularies Project, which includes reference vocabularies in cultural heritage, such as the Art and Architecture Thesaurus (AAT). 6Research infrastructures in Europe make extensive use of SKOS vocabularies for knowledge organisation and interoperability purposes. DARIAH, the European research infrastructure on which ROSSIO is integrated, makes available a vocabulary repository (Vocabs).7 Among the hosted vocabularies, we highlight the Backbone Thesaurus (BBT), a top-level thesaurus for alignment of domain or project-specific SKOS vocabularies [18]. The Finnish LOD Infrastructure for Digital Humanities (LODI4DH), a joint initiative of several academic institutions, is anchored on a thesaurus and ontology service (Finto) 8 , which is managed by the National Library of Finland [9]. Finto consists of a collection of aligned SKOS concept schemes, including general and domain-specific vocabularies [8]. As part of LODI4DH, Finto's vocabularies are employed for annotation and search in a series of semantic portals.","refs":[{"start":359,"end":362,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b4"},{"start":362,"end":364,"marker":"bibr","target":null},{"start":570,"end":573,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b1"},{"start":890,"end":894,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b13"},{"start":894,"end":897,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b15"},{"start":897,"end":900,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b19"},{"start":1065,"end":1066,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_3"},{"start":1324,"end":1325,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_4"},{"start":1484,"end":1488,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b18"},{"start":1664,"end":1665,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_5"},{"start":1720,"end":1723,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b9"},{"start":1840,"end":1843,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b8"}]},{"text":"A notable application of Semantic Web vocabularies is Europeana, which provides access to over 50 million digitised cultural heritage objects provided by European institutions in the GLAM sector. 9 The Europeana Data Model (EDM) includes several SKOS elements for the enrichment of provided cultural heritage objects based on so-called 'contextual entities', i.e. agents, places and concepts [5]. The contextualisation efforts of Europeana have included the design of an 'Entity Collection', a knowledge graph that re-uses third-party data and maps entities to EDM [3]. A further initiative is the evaluation of third-party knowledge bases for enrichment and disambiguation purposes, e.g. VIAF with regard to agents [6]. These examples highlight the potential of SKOS vocabularies for content discovery, management and contextualisation in digital libraries and research infrastructures.

The main elements of the thesaurus are instances of skos:Concept. The latter are lexicalised by terms (i.e., preferred, alternative and hidden labels) in Portuguese. As a minimum requirement, the preferred labels are translated to English, either through automatic translation and verification or by reusing English terms from reference KOS or other vocabulary resources. There will be the possibility of documenting concepts (e.g. through scope notes) and identifying their sources, which will be mostly relevant for identifying the corresponding terms provided by our partner institutions. Concepts in the ROSSIO Thesaurus are mapped to reference concept schemes in domains within SSAH by means of SKOS mapping properties (e.g. skos:exactMatch, skos:broadMatch).

Several individuals are included, however, corresponding to names of disciplines (e.g. 'sociology'), styles (e.g. 'Rococo') and movements (e.g. 'Dadaism'), among other possibilities. 11As part of the ROSSIO Infrastructure, the thesaurus should be complemented by other concept schemes comprising, e.g., place names, person and organisation names and time-periods, as well as domain-specific vocabularies used within the infrastructure, such as the thesaurus on cultural heritage that is being developed by one of our partner institutions, the Directorate General for Cultural Heritage.

The latter task required the extraction of English and Portuguese AAT terms through the SPARQL endpoint of the Getty Vocabularies Project.

A platform is being developed to provide search and content curation services for researchers and the general public, namely digital collections, digital exhibitions and a virtual research environment. The ROSSIO Thesaurus is being developed to support content discovery and management in the platform. The thesaurus is being modelled as a SKOS concept scheme, and it leverages on existing unstructured vocabularies, such as subject headings and thesauri, produced by the ROSSIO data providers. This paper describes the modelling process of the ROSSIO Thesaurus, its integration and role in the infrastructure, its publication as Linked Open Data, and the results of this work after 6 months of development.","refs":[]}]}}
