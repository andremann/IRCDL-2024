Naturally, Floridi refers to data of all sorts, not necessarily the sort of data libraries organise, yet the scenario raises questions: is it imaginable that librariesor any other subjectsucceed in organizing that data? Digital libraries, especially research libraries, are probably busy enough with the preservation and dissemination of research in the digital ecosystem; librarians do not only honour their historical commitment to \"serving\", but accomplish their more recent rolestemmed from the new competencies necessary to manage digital libraries, collections and Open Access-of mediators between science and society. They can greatly contribute to efficiently disseminating the results of scientific research, as it was the case for the partnership between Charlotte Hess and Elinor Olstrom. Their work was originated by the Workshop on Scholarly Communication As a Commons, led by Olstrom at the University of Indiana in 2004, an attempt to define the concept of commons from a multidisciplinary point of view. Knowledge as a commons is a shared resource, like natural resources, but, unlike water or fisheries, it is impossible to exclude someone from knowledge once it has been made public-whereas the book it is written in is a piece of private property. At the time they wrote, they were Director of the Digital Library of the Commons at Indiana University and 2009 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences: the book [3] resulting from the workshop contains papers from those who were to become the most prominent experts and advocates of Open Access.","refs":[{"start":178,"end":181,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b0"},{"start":181,"end":183,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b1"},{"start":288,"end":291,"marker":"bibr","target":null},{"start":2005,"end":2008,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b2"}]},{"text":"As librarians develop into researchers, the ethics of science, prime mover of research, gets closer to the basic principles of the library mission, mainly allowing people to find the information they need to advance their knowledge and become active citizens [4].

Pietro Greco [10] underlines the need to raise citizens' awareness on scientific issues, they need to know before they make decision on their health or on their environment; a model for this attitude is Al Gore's engagement both in environmental communication and popularization [11] for which he was awarded the 2007 Nobel Prize for Peace -and in converting MEDLINE to PubMed under the Clinton Administration in 1997, thus making a precious informational resource available on Open Access to everyone worldwide, not just to the taxpayers. Advancement in science cannot happen without democracy [10], as they share the same basic principles: during Hitler's regime, science moved from Nazi Germany to the USA, where democracy was granted.

Researchers are interested in content, librarians are interested in context and reliability, their look is supposed to be objective and unbiased according to their Code of Ethics. The mission of libraries is thus described by IFLA FAIFE's Code of Ethics [16]: Librarians and other information workers organize and present content in a way that allows an autonomous user to find the information s/he needs. Librarians and other information workers help and support users in their information searching, and, according to IFLA/UNESCO [4] The mission of the digital library is to give direct access to information resources, both digital and non-digital, in a structured and authoritative manner and thus to link information technology, education and culture in contemporary library service.","refs":[{"start":41,"end":45,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b14"},{"start":704,"end":708,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b15"},{"start":982,"end":985,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b3"}]},{"text":"Thinking in this perspective about the aims of the Open Access movement clarifies immediately why libraries are a stakeholder in this scenario; besides, the Budapest Open Access Initiative [9] invites libraries, among the others who share the same vision, to join us in the task of removing the barriers to Open Access and building a future in which research and education in every part of the world are that much more free to flourish.

This convergence would allow library and information professionals to tell the story of what they can do for the organisation, preservation, and consistent construction of metadata to represent data themselves. The benefits of such open attitude, apart from the collaboration between Ostrom and Hess mentioned above, are demonstrated in the case of Luisella Goldschmidt-Clermont (1925-2013), librarian at CERN and sociologist, whose pre-print [19], though never published at the time, was fully acknowledged in the light of the OA movement, as the author's meta-reflection contributes to highlighting the mutual growth that could result for physics, anthropology and library science from the mutual exchange: being married to a scientist, she had the privilege of observing the physicists' community in action. Moreover, the role of libraries is visible in the reasons and benefits that led Ginsparg to transfer arXiv from Los Alamos to the University of Cornell as well as in the contribution of librarians in IRIS, the Italian archive for scholarly publications, where librarians are in charge of the curation, the creation of metadata, the advocacy of the repository among scholars and their training.","refs":[{"start":12,"end":16,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b17"},{"start":1131,"end":1135,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b18"}]},{"text":"The above-mentioned IFLA/UNESCO Manifesto for Digital Libraries mentions the importance to overcome the Digital divide to pursue the Millennium Development Goals, and states that the dissemination of information enables citizens to participate in life-long learning and education; in line with other IFLA/FAIFE Code of Ethics and other IFLA documents, user education is one of the missions of every sort of library, and the education to digital content, or media literacy, is carried out by all species of libraries for their different audiences.

A dramatic acceleration to the trend was given in 1997 when the government decided to pay for the database, considered a necessary public resource, so the domain changed from .com to .gov and the name updated to PubMed. After this, to increase the findability and overcome cultural barriers, PubMedPlus, multilingual, was started in 1998, with a Spanish interface and a thesaurus mediating between medical specialized terms and common language; in 2000 PubMedCentral added a collection of full-text documents to the bibliographic database.

The Odones were told that the rare illness of their son would have taken him to death in two years' time: they were educated people, they decided to research. The father went to the library in the first place; at the timethe end of the 1960sthere was no Internet available to common citizens. Besides, geography favoured them: the nearest library was the one of the National Institute of Health, in Bethesda, Maryland, the greatest medical library in the world. Though not being medical practitioners themselves, they were people with a higher education background and the husband, Augusto, worked at the World Bank, in an international context. They had acquired the right competencies to look for documentation in their fields of expertise, but now they needed to search in an unknown field. The illness of their son made them transfer those skills into another area, and these skills proved successful: they were able to conduct cross-searches on Medline, other biomedical databases and Index Medicus, which were all, at the time, proprietary tools whose use was dearly paid for. For six months, in line with the code of ethics of the library service, the Bethesda Library enabled the Odones to use those advanced research tools for free, within the library premisesit should be noted, besides, that Bethesda was the place where Medline server was physically located. At the end, the mixture they came up with, the so-called \"oil\", allowed Lorenzo to live 20 years longer.

Search engines can make themselves perfectly understandable, but reliability is not their mission. Google's original mission statement in 1998 was to organise the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. In 2014 Larry Page expressed his doubts that the company probably needed a new statement, but he was not sure which one would actually fit in with what they were doing at the time. Google may be born under the star of that initial mission, but in order to thrive offering free tools it relied on advertisers. Naturally, the mission of every business company is to support itself: Google made and is still making many amazing projects feasible, many of them in and with libraries, yet it would be irresponsible to put a company in charge of organizing, preserving and granting access to world knowledge, this is a task for governments and people's institutions [26][27][28]. As an aside, the concept of Open Access and free of charge are not overlapping: scholarly publications can be offered free of charge because they have been publicly funded, and therefore belong to the community, they are a commons, unlike resources which are offered free of charge because some company or corporation is trying to get to the consumers through them.","refs":[{"start":985,"end":989,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b25"},{"start":989,"end":993,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b26"},{"start":993,"end":997,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b27"}]},{"text":"Digital libraries should contribute to raise awareness and increase knowledge, and they definitely strive to do so, also acting as advocates of Open Access, by encouraging authors to deposit in open repositories and making directories of such repositories widely known [29].

Recently a German magazine [30] published an investigation demonstrating, according to the authors, that Open Access research is not necessarily of scholarly quality. The investigators made up a Mr. R. Funden -\"Erfunden\" in German means \"made up, invented\" -gave him life, and he received some invitations from predatory publishers in the seven months the investigation lasted. The findings might be interesting and made a case in Germany, but they are not news to those into scholarly publishing. According to the authors, the investigation would prove that, provided anyone has the money, they can make themselves a scholarly reputation and be published along with highly-reputed scholars, whose names are sometimes simply used without their knowledge and at other times before they realized who they were publishing with. Other, better informed, sources [25] recall previous similar enquiries and underline the poor data support in the present investigation and state that such examples should not undermine the whole OA movement. Taking the story with the necessary caution, this goes back to what we were saying above: the increase in the information available does not make libraries redundant. Since the main commitment of the librarians is to organize information itself, more than using it to create knowledge in a specific disciplinary field, they are more and more needed on the digital scenario to select sources and train users. Would David's mother be able to understand that the water is poisoned? Probably not, but she has more chances of becoming aware of that than David himself does: she is in charge of the household after all, whereas he is simply in charge of growing up.","refs":[{"start":143,"end":147,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b29"},{"start":973,"end":977,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b24"}]}]},{"title":"Conclusion","paragraphs":[{"text":"The digital revolution is on, as well as the Open Access movement, which, through the three declarations (Budapest, Bethesda, Berlin) made great steps forward.","refs":[]},{"text":"The huge amount of online free information does not push the libraries out of the game, on the contrary it makes them even more useful, as when everybody is producing open knowledge the mechanisms for distribution that otherwise rely on large private companies cannot be taken for granted.","refs":[]},{"text":"Great investment is required from the research institutions and the libraries to face the issues related to the accessibility and the usability of the resourcesand their preservation too, though this article chose not to did not deal with the latter.
