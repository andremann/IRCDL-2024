The educational system modernization forces scientists to look for ways to solve a pressing issue. Today, one of the most important tools for solving this issue can be the use of cloud technologies. They are more and more popular among teachers due to their dynamism and multifunctionality as they are based on a service-oriented architectural model, the so-called SOA, which provides a much lower cost of software (SW), and hardware; organizes information security (questionable service); and offers a variety of education services.

Thanks to these technologies, education becomes closer to the student, because of learning, which is more accessible and interesting. In connection with global trends and modern challenges, educational institutions must prepare a \"future specialist\", by using the existing tools, implementing modern technologies, organizing educational activities, using the developed services, and structuring their information and communication competencies. These technologies have recently entered the field of education, so the relevance of the topic is beyond doubt.

Now, students cannot be limited only by traditional educational means, the system requires new educational technologies, methods and forms. Any activity, including SIW, can be arranged with the support of cloud technologies, you just need to have the appropriate competencies, desires and time. Cloud technologies make possible to penetrate the student's mind to a greater extent with their interactivity, multimedia, virtuality, etc. The SIW effectiveness can be achieved only when there is a student's motivation. To reach it, the teacher must think carefully about the process organizing students' independence. It should not be forgotten that students need to be independent (self-developed, self-improved, self-educated), to work on improving their personality and on their professional growth. To do this, the teacher must select a toolkit in the organizational process that encourages the self-development implementation, the timely completion of assigned tasks, the use of creativity to achieve the goal.","refs":[{"start":234,"end":238,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b22"},{"start":238,"end":241,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b23"},{"start":355,"end":359,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b24"},{"start":390,"end":394,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b25"},{"start":394,"end":397,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b26"},{"start":664,"end":668,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b27"},{"start":668,"end":671,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b28"}]},{"text":"During the study, performed within the framework of T.H. Shevchenko National University \"Chernihiv Collegium\" and Rivne State Humanitarian University the students' independent work has been organized for the EG students by means of the Google Apps for Education cloud technologies and web services in the following order: 1) A learning environment (website), which contains important educational material and the base software necessary for performing independent tasks, has been created; 2) Students have been combined into groups (2-3 people) to solve the tasks; 3) A common journal table (Google Sheets) has been created for students to fill in data on assignments; 4) A personal folder has been created for each student to store the SIW results with the provision of editing access rights (to the student and the teacher-curator-tutor); 5) A protection of tasks has been organized by students in the university auditorium.

Thanks to the cloud services, students have had the opportunity to consult more with the teacher; \"not to be attached\" to the place; to have some interactivity, high-quality software, and the teacher easily assessed the results of the tasks performed. Upon the training completion, a survey of all the respondents was conducted. It has established how students are familiar with services.","refs":[]},{"text":"After analyzing the data, we can say that the use of cloud technologies is at a low level. Only 60 percent of students know or have got to know about cloud technologies before. These are students of senior courses, where some of them got acquainted with them only during the SIW organization. The notion \"cloud technologies\" [30] is understand by students as a technology that stores data remotely. Unfortunately, students do not know about the colossal possibilities of cloud technologies (web services). The survey results are shown in (figure 1). To begin with, it has been established whether the respondents are familiar with such a notion as \"cloud technologies\". As a result of the survey, 16 percent of respondents do not know this notion. Respondents mostly believe that these are technologies that help to store data remotely. This suggests that more than half have known or heard from others about these technologies. After analyzing the results, it should be noted that not all the students have information about the capabilities of the Google Docs service, and this is 30 percent. It has been found that on an average 13 percent of respondents are unaware of Google Sheets, Presentations, Forms and their capabilities. To find out how students see the usefulness of cloud services for educational purposes and whether they want to know about their capabilities in the future, following questions have been prepared: \"Would you like to learn more about the practical value of using services: Google Docs, Presentations, Forms, Spreadsheets, Calendars, Photos, Cards?\" to which the students answered: \"yes\" -85 percent, and 15 percent of the suspected. Moreover, some students prefer to get more familiar with the work of individual services, such as: Word Learner, OneDrive cloud storage, Google Drive, Google Sheets, Google Contacts, Google Docs, Bloger, Google Photos, Demo Animate, Wikimapia, Glogster, Eliademy, Educaplay.","refs":[{"start":325,"end":329,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b29"},{"start":546,"end":547,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_0"}]},{"text":"To complete the experiment, students have been asked to carry out tasks, prepared through the web services (Learning Apps, Master Test, WordArt (Tagul), OnlineTestPad, Glogster, etc.) every other day.

The survey has revealed cloud environments, which are known to students. Respondents have had the option to choose multiple cloud environments. The results are presented in (figure 2) . After reviewing the data, we can conclude that the most famous cloud technologies among students are: Google Drive, OneDrive, iCloud, Dropox. No wonder, as they are the market leaders and are very popular among users around the world. As for the effect of using cloud environments by students, unfortunately, the situation is different, this phenomenon is not common among students. According to the survey, students mainly use cloud environments like Google Drive -69.4 percent; OneDrive -22.6 percent; iCloud -19.4 percent; do not use any -24.2 percent; single use: e-Disk -12.9 percent; Dropbox -9.7 percent.

It is worth noting that on average 6percent of students consider cloud technologies useless for educational purposes, namely: Caurserra.org, Mindomo, Bloger. It can be explained by the fact that these services are less known to students than others as their capabilities are unknown for them. It is appropriate that services, mentioned herein, have more practical use among teachers to familiarize students with benefits of each service.","refs":[]},{"text":"Thus, with the help of cloud technologies, students have become united. They have learned how to work within a team and it is a significant professional quality. Moreover, they have gained some experience in working with web services, and have increased the motivation for learning. 76 percent of students have coped with the tasks perfectly well, as a result, the final score has increased. According to students, it is more interesting to complete tasks (87 percent), the ability to use materials anywhere, and anytime (100 percent), the assessment transparency (90 percent), the teacher's consultations, better established (95 percent). Summing up the survey results, one may state that the senior students' majority knows about cloud technologies, but does not know how to use them correctly on an individual basis. In general, the study points to enormous possibilities of cloud technologies in the SIW organization, providing great benefits to students and teachers; deprives educational institutions of the burden of software and hardware ongoing support; forms students' creativity, teamwork skills, development of creative abilities, information competence, and technological literacy. The main locus is the teachers' motivation to use modern tools for the educational process structuring, since most of them really use the powerful capabilities of cloud services.
