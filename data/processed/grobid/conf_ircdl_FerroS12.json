Indeed, in the creation phase archivists have to select and describe the archival material and annotations allow them to explain and discuss their choices enabling users to properly access and consult the archival metadata. In the consultation phase, annotations are exploited to find out relationships between different parts of an archive or between different archives; for instance, users can exploit annotations to move from one archive to another guided by the expertise of the archivists that annotated them. In order to properly exploit annotations in the archival context we have to take into account the heterogeneous environment composed of digital archive systems and annotation systems which are often grounded on different methodological and technological approaches. The archival community has developed \"content and data structure standards\" [15] to facilitate the description, management and access to the archival resources; however, these standards can be difficult for archivists to use [19] and are often implemented in ways that can negatively affect their description activity [20].

An archive is the trace of the activities of a physical or juridical person in the course of their business which is preserved because of their continued value. Archives have to keep the context in which their records have been created and the network of relationships between them in order to preserve their informative content and provide understandable and useful information over time [10]. The context and the relationships between the documents are preserved thanks to the hierarchical organization of the documents inside the archive. Indeed, an archive is divided by fonds and then by sub-fonds and then by series and then by sub-series and so on -see Figure 1a for an example; at every level we can find documents belonging to a particular division of the archive or documents describing the nature of the considered level of the archive (e.g. a fonds, a sub-fonds, etc.). The union of all these documents, the relationships and the context information permits the full informational power of the archival documents to be maintained.

Both these set data models, formally defined in the context of set theory, can be used to model an archive by means of nested sets [8].

The set created from the tree's root is the only set with no subsets and the root set is a proper subset of all the sets in the hierarchy. The leaves are the sets with no supersets and they are sets containing all the sets created from the nodes composing the tree path from a leaf to the root. We can represent in a straightforward way the INS-M by means of the \"DocBall representation\" [17] see Figure 1b. It is worthwhile to understand how the DocBall is used because the graphical tool we are going to present is based on this idea. The DocBall Fig. 2. A document-annotation hypertext and its subgraph composed of the \"annotate\" edges which is a forest composed of two trees is composed of a set of circular sectors arranged in concentric rings; each ring represents a level of the hierarchy with the center representing the root.

An example is the MPEG-71 which is a standard for annotating and describing multimedia content data; the Semantic Web is another example of where annotations are exploited, in particular in the context of the Annotea project developed by the W3C2 . In the context of DL an example is Collaboratory for Annotation Indexing and Retrieval of Digitized Historical Archive Material (COLLATE) [16], which supports the collaboration among film scientists and archivists. Another relevant example is FAST which adopts and implements the formal model for annotations proposed in [4]. FAST distinguishes between documents -which are generic digital objects managed by a DL -and annotations. Annotations can be associated with a digital object by two types of link: annotate link and relate-to link. An annotate link allows an annotation to be linked to a part of a digital object; through this link it is possible to express intra-digital object relationships between different parts of an object. A relate-to link is intended to allow an annotation only to relate to one or more parts of other digital objects, but not the annotated one; therefore it expresses inter-digital object relationships. From these definitions annotations can be seen as a means of linking digital objects. Annotations permit us to create new relationships between the components of a digital object, between different digital objects of the same DL or between digital objects belonging to different DL. As shown in [4] the set of digital objects and annotations form a labeled directed acyclic graph called document-annotation hypertext. Furthermore, each annotation must annotate only one digital object, and it has been shown [4] that for each document there is a unique tree of annotations constituted by \"annotate\" edges that can be rooted in the document.

On the other hand, the EAD permissive data model may undermine the very interoperability it is intended to foster and it must meet stringent best practice guidelines to be shareable and searchable [15].

In the first scenario we consider an archival tree where the node d 2 , annotated by a 1 , is the root of an annotation tree composed of three annotations. The second scenario shows that a 3 which is part of an annotation tree annotating d 2 is connected to a second archive by means of a \"relate-to\" link. In the third scenario, we can see two archives connected by a relate-to link defined between two annotations -i.e. a relate-to link between a 3 and a 5 .

The resulting DocBall is shown in Figure 4a, where a 1 is a superset of d 2 . The second scenario presents the same annotated archive we have seen in the first scenario enriched by the relationship of annotation a 3 with the node d 9 of a second archive. In this case, we use a DocBall representing the first archive within its annotations -call it \"DocBall A\" (see Figure 4a) -and a DocBall representing the second archivecall it \"DocBall B\".

So, we follow the methodology presented for scenario 2 by taking the inner sector of DocBall B -i.e. d 8 which represents the root of the second archive -and adding it to DocBall A as a superset of the annotation -in this case a 3 -which relates the two archives together. The general methodology of joining two DocBall together can be summarized as follows; let D A and D B be two DocBall, where section s A of D A is related to section s B of D B .

The tool highlights the related sections; indeed, when d 2 is selected, the DocBall rotates in such a way that its annotation tree moves on the top of the DocBall, and annotation a 3 together with section d 9 are colored in red reveling the connection between them. The user can explore the content of these sections by means of the tooltip while visualizing the content of d 2 in the right column. In Figure 7 we captured the tooltip related to a 3 ; we can see that it reports the content of the annotation and the information about its relationship with section d 9 .","refs":[{"start":287,"end":288,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_4"},{"start":401,"end":403,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_3"},{"start":810,"end":811,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_5"},{"start":1428,"end":1429,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_5"}]},{"text":"Figure 8 shows the last scenario where we exploit the relationship between two annotations -i.e. a 3 and a 5 -to relate two different archives.

The use of colors may be an effective way to distinguish between the sectors which are documents and those which are annotations. Furthermore, the DocBall could become ineffective if there are many sectors that have to be represented. In this case an expand/compress strategy could be adopted as well as it is used to shows the branches of very large trees.

This service can address interoperability issues between different digital archive systems and annotation systems in a flexible and scalable way by exploiting existing and widely-diffused software modules -i.e. OAI Data and Service Provider -and extending them by means of lightweight software modules -i.e. the NESTOR driver. The presented prototype of the service enables a comprehensive view of archival structure and content together with its annotations; furthermore, it highlights the relationships between different archives. This service can enhance the role of annotations in the archival context and the expertise of archivists in the description as well as in the consultation phase of the archives.","refs":[]},{"text":"Future work foresees the adoption of this service in the context of a project of the Italian Veneto Region5 .
