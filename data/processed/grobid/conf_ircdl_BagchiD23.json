the tallest building in the entire world. It is variously modelled as, for instance, a skyscraper in a cadastral database, a hotel in a tourist database, a corporate complex in an event management database and a vertical obstruction in an air traffic database. Such heterogeneity, whether in the aforementioned example of Burj Khalifa, or, in general, for any real-world entity, are ubiquitous and are considered as instantiations of the phenomenon of semantic heterogeneity [1]. The central tenet behind such heterogeneity in conceptual modelling remains the fact that representations are fundamentally cognitive constructs [2,3] and are, non-trivially, grounded in the very way in which (human) conceptualizations are causally generated from (human) experientiality [4,5,6]. Amongst the many socio-technical ramifications of such heterogeneity of semantic representations, we are particularly interested in the problem of harmonizing such diverse conceptual representations into a unified ontological schema which can be exploited later, for instance, to classify and integrate open heterogeneous data [7], e.g., about the Burj Khalifa.","refs":[{"start":531,"end":534,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b0"},{"start":681,"end":684,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b1"},{"start":684,"end":686,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b2"},{"start":824,"end":827,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b3"},{"start":827,"end":829,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b4"},{"start":829,"end":831,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b5"},{"start":1160,"end":1163,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b6"}]},{"text":"We model the aforementioned instantiation of the heterogeneity of conceptual representations to be essentially that of the phenomenon of Conceptual Entanglement, viz., an ordered manifoldness ('entanglement') from the (perceptual) generation of concepts to their logical formalization, immanent across (every) conceptualizations. To that end, we outline five characteristically autonomous yet functionally linked levels into which Conceptual Entanglement distributes. The first level of entanglement is generated due to the different ways in which different real-world entities can be perceived. The second level of entanglement arises due to the different ways in which different concepts perceived can be named. The third level of entanglement pertains to the different top-level ontological distinctions [8,9] into which each of such named concepts can be semantically aligned and constrained to. The fourth level of entanglement, given the top-level semantic alignment, instantiates as the different ways in which different lexicalized concepts can be hierarchically modelled. The fifth and the final level of entanglement occurs due to the different ways in which different concepts in the lexical hierarchy can be intensionally characterized.","refs":[{"start":807,"end":810,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b7"},{"start":810,"end":812,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b8"}]},{"text":"Our solution approach has the fundamental assumption that there is \"only one 'real world' but many different descriptions of this world depending on the aims, methodology and terminology of the observer\" [10].
