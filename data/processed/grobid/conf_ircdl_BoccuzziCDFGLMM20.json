The well-studied subjects in the new field of Diplomatics promoted by Rück have been however the striking graphic features of the charters issued by rulers and elites or written by public notaries of high medieval Europe (10th-12th century), and the few comparative analyses have so far been conducted mainly on high and late medieval western sources. Recent years have seen a renewed interest in the graphic aspects of early medieval written sources, and some works have shown also the connection between Late Antiquity and early Middle Ages; they have dealt, however, only with some specific signs (crosses, christograms and monograms) selected in advance as graphic signs of identity, faith, and power, disseminated in diverse media, but not in documentary records. The project NOTAE represents therefore the first attempt to conduct a research on graphic symbols in documentary records from Late Antiquity to early medieval Europe from a novel perspective: in the long historical period in question, drawing symbols had a major social impact, because, provided it was done in one's own hand, it placed on the same footing professional scribes, basic literates and illiterates. For illiterates, it certainly meant, both in the late Roman state (a Greek-Latin graphic and linguistic community) and in the post-Roman kingdoms (as long as Latin functioned as language of vertical communication) a way of taking an active part in the writing process.

A standard way to binarize an image is to choose a threshold and to convert every pixel of the image to 1 if a specific combination of the components of the color of the pixel is above/below the threshold, to 0 otherwise. The choice of the threshold depends on the specific document and is not possible to find a one-fits-all solution. As the approach followed by the NOTAE system consists in involving the curators in a man-in-the-loop process, we decided to follow an approach that leaves the choice of the threshold to the curator. Instead of allowing him to choose any value though, we applied an approach that computes five possible thresholds based on the employment of K-means. It is a centroidbased clustering algorithm that, given a set of points in a coordinate space, the RGB color space in our case, groups them into K sets, where the parameter K is given as an input to the algorithm according to some distance function, usually the euclidean distance. The output of the algorithm is a set of K centroids providing the center of each group in the coordinate space. These centroids will be in our case specific colors. Figure 3 shows the result of the execution of K-means with K set to 4 on four different documents. Colors are ordered from left to right according to an increasing red component.","refs":[{"start":1321,"end":1322,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_2"}]},{"text":"Once the clustering step has been executed, the five thresholds are computed as (i) the red component of the first color extracted which is different from black, (ii) the red component of the second color extracted which is different from black, (iii) the average value between the first two threshold values, (iv) the average between the first and third thresholds, and (v) the average between the second and third thresholds.","refs":[]},{"text":"Once the thresholds have been determined, we move on to the effective removal of the background and generation of the binary images.

At this point a very simple filtering, i.e., erosion, is applied to bring to the foreground the marginal components of the writing. At this point, we turn every pixel different from 1 into 0.

To limit the binarization time, we decided to resize the original image, working with a small-sized version of the document and the original-sized version. The small-sized version is obtained by downsizing the original reproduction to 10% of its size. This version is employed for clustering and choosing the threshold.

In order to perform this task, we apply template matching. This is a method for searching and finding the location of a template image in a larger image. It simply slides the template image over the input image and compares the template with the current part of the original image. Several comparison methods are possible. Template matching returns a grayscale image, where each pixel denotes how much the neighborhood of that pixel matches the template. Template matching is performed using all different symbols available in the NOTAE System DB. As the size in terms of pixels of the symbols in the NOTAE System DB depends on the original document, applying template match to a single version of a document would likely return several false negatives. As a consequence, we apply template matching to several different scales of the document, keeping track of the best match, and after looping over all scales, we take the global best match as our matched region. At each step, we collect the coordinates of each match for each template used, and we use these coordinates to draw different rectangles on the image. The result on an example document is shown in Fig. 5. As can be easily understood, the obtained result is not satisfying, as it contains too many rectangles and too many false positives.

DBSCAN also returns points that were not included in any clusters.

As in the case of binarization, the bottleneck of this method is certainly the dimension of the digital reproduction of the document.
