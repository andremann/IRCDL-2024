The services offered by digital libraries are only effective if the content they manage meets the requirements of integrity, consistency and reliability (a term related to the much more complex concept of authenticity). This article proposes a reflection on what the emerging discipline of digital philology means in the preparation of cultural digital material aimed at digital libraries.

In other words, the digital representation of data (the bit stream) and the organization and presentation of the data (the cultural interfaces [2]) are not neutral with respect to the final perception that users have of the 'real' or 'original' object, which may often not be available for comparison. In addition, the relationship between the digital objects and the real objects they allegedly represent \"is not only very complex, it also develops over time\" [1, p. 10]. In order to ensure that the electronic sources, that scholars and the general public are getting more and more accustomed to refer to for their research and personal interest, meet the requirements of authoritativeness, accuracy and reliability (see Sect. 2), it is necessary to define what makes a digital document authoritative, accurate and reliable. This definition implies the understanding of what the document means in its cultural context and it is therefore not limited to technical questions that only computer scientists and engineers should be in charge of. \"Digital philology\" is the multidisciplinary research field that addresses this problems. While philology (\"without adjectives\" [3, p. 65]) has a long tradition, the reflections about digital philology are very recent, and so is the academic production about it. There is much work to be done in order to provide new methodological and operative tools to scholars whose aim is to author electronic editions based on digital sources.

Unless certain criteria to ensure that digital audio (and other multimedia) can be considered authoritative, accurate and reliable sources [4], this trend may be hard to get rid of in the future. Besides the on-going multiplication of digitized documents, the number of born digital documents is also increasing, making the definition of procedures for storage and cataloguing even more urgent because a \"physical original\" is never available for comparison. The hybrid nature of multimedia installations imposes the consideration of a grey zone between analogue, digitized and born digital documents, i.e. cultural material where meaning is found in the integration of physical and virtual elements.","refs":[{"start":781,"end":784,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b3"}]},{"text":"This article is organized as follows: Sect. 2 explores the concept of digital philology, with specific connections with traditional philology and textual criticism.

For example, Origen's third-century Hexapla presented six versions of the Old Testament (including the Hebrew text, a transliteration of the Hebrew in Greek characters, and four Greek translations) in parallel alignment [6]. The comparison, a core activity in the philological analysis, is implicitly based on a notion of \"text\". According to philology, any text is a variant copy of an archetypal text, which the philologist is trying to reconstruct. Before even mentioning sound and music, let us consider how the adjective \"digital\" is associated to the term \"philology\". First of all, the simple fact that a text is represented in electronic format and examined on a computer screen rather than a paper book does not justify the expression \"digital philology\". Just as an electronic reproduction of Leonardo's Mona Lisa is not \"digital art\". The medium is certainly not neutral, and we are addressing this issue in a few lines, but the adjective \"digital\" next to philology needs to have a greater impact on the concepts and the methods of philology. It is, in fact, a new research field, stemming out of the combination of two disciplines: philology and computer science. Computer science brings to the table its approach, some of its concepts and methodologies -not only technology. From its part, philology is changed in its own concepts and methods thanks to the encounter with computer science. \"Going beyond, discovering the new frontiers of philology, does not depend on the computer. It depends on us, the scholars\" -said Marcos Marìn in 2001, when apparently \"many people [were] still looking at computers as enemies of the intellectual activity that has characterized the approach to texts from the beginning. We are not convincing them by saying that we get more accurate accounts of words, or thousands of examples. What is different is not the quantity, it is the new insights, the new questions that we can ask.\" [7] The advantages that computer science offers \"traditional\" philology (or probably we could start saying non-digital philology) are twofold:","refs":[{"start":66,"end":75,"marker":"bibr","target":null},{"start":440,"end":443,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b5"},{"start":2151,"end":2154,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b6"}]},{"text":"1. technological tools (for quantitative analyses and for sharing corpora through a network); 2. methods and concepts that stem from a theoretical reflection.","refs":[]},{"text":"From the point of view of how deeply computer science modifies philology by contributing to it, two distinct steps can also be distinguished:","refs":[]},{"text":"1. preparation of the working materials; 2. support to textual criticism (assisted or [semi]automated analyses).","refs":[]},{"text":"Often the expression \"digital philology\" refers to the \"effort of reproducing texts on paper in electronic format as faithfully as possible\" (point 1), but the output of this operation is in fact \"the starting point of the philologist's work\" [3, p. 68]. Although it is desirable that the second step is also accomplished (point 2), this first and preliminary step is crucial because the trans-coding of the text may lose some information and/or introduce errors and artefacts. While the digitization of a text can happen in multiple ways (direct acquisition by means of scanner device, or text encoding by means of formal languages, often based on tags such as XML), audio is generally digitized by extracting the signal from the source medium and by memorizing it onto another medium (usually a redundant array of independent disks). Innovative methods to store audio recordings are based on optical systems such as PoG (Photos of GHOSTS: Photos of Grooves and HOles, Supporting Tracks Separation) [8]. These systems may not only bring about new approaches in the workflow of preservation, but could (and should) trigger new reflections on the meaning of re-mediation itself. Regardless of the source medium and of the digitization technique, it should be clear that re-mediation and [cultural] trans-coding are never neutral operations.","refs":[{"start":243,"end":252,"marker":"bibr","target":null},{"start":1000,"end":1003,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b7"}]}]},{"title":"Preparation of the Working Materials","paragraphs":[{"text":"\"Even an image capture and editing, which may at first sight be a rather straightforward and 'objective' procedure [. . . ] require intellectual, critical choices, interpretation, and manipulation.\" [9] In order to plan and to perform the trans-coding, it is necessary to have a model of the object/document. The definition of the model is where computer science and philology may have communication problems, because \"humanities generally show terminological ambiguity due to the heterogeneous and elusive object of study\", while computer science deals by definition with the \"processing of data (encoded information) expressed in non-ambiguous languages\" [10, p. 48]. Creating a model of the object to be digitized means to analyze it and to select what relevant features will represent it. And as a reminder of the multidisciplinary approach that should characterize any work in this field, it is important to keep in mind that the creation of the model is not required exclusively for the sake of the computer: it should rather be seen as an \"important space for analysis and for the formalization of the knowledge about the subject of the study\" [10, p. 53].","refs":[{"start":199,"end":202,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b8"},{"start":657,"end":667,"marker":"bibr","target":null},{"start":1151,"end":1162,"marker":"bibr","target":null}]},{"text":"The definition of the model is a \"crucial\" part of the preliminary activities (see [1, p. 11] quoted in Sect. 1): any further analysis will manipulate the electronic representations of the original physical objects. Gigliozzi [10] suggests that a model already underlies any written text (a code for graphic symbols, syntax, narrativity, language, . . . ), and that it can be useful to reflect on what features make it effectively represent the message (information) intended by the author. Starting the transition to the audio domain, the notion of \"text\" is among the first to be defined. Is any recording of an acoustic event or electronic composition a witness of the archetypical sound? Is there anything such as an archetypical sound at all? In the authors' methodology (see Sect. 3.2, and [11,12] for more exhaustive explanations) every audio document is considered a \"master\" recording in the sense that it bears witness of the acoustic event in a unique way, due to the manipulation and conditions that the document has been subject to through the years, including the mere ageing of the carrier.

The documents for access may have been re-organized during the cataloguing, in function of the contents: the type of object that is produced directly from the digitization is called \"preservation copy\" and is by definition the equivalent of the diplomatic edition (see [13]). According to the definition of diplomatic edition, the eventual mistakes or imperfections of the physical document are maintained in the digital copy, because they provide information about the author's creative process (e.g., erased words), about the history of transmission of the document, and about the ageing of the document (from dog-eared pages to patches of mould).

This goal is also achieved thanks to original open-source software developed on purpose at the CSC [12], as well as with the multidisciplinary approach that distinguishes the methodology for audio preservation of the CSC (mainly information engineering, music[ology] and chemistry). \"The creation of digital objects has to meet the standards of the various disciplines involved, and [. . . ] is a crucial part of humanities research.

Audio and video (Fig. 3) are acquired on separate machines, and the entire re-mediation system is connected for safety to uninterruptible power supplies (UPS). A professional STUDER A-810 with stereo heads is used to read most tapes 1/4 in. wide.

Thermal treatment, performed with the incubator, consists in applying consistent heat to the tapes over a specified period of time; it is aimed at reverting the effects of the so-called Soft Binder Syndrome -Sticky Shed Syndrome (SBS-SSS) [18]. Among the effects of this condition are sticking, squealing, and abnormal shedding of the magnetic coating. It should be noted that not all tapes are suitable for thermal treatment. In order to find alternate recovery methods, chemical analyses and experiments are currently being performed by the CSC in collaboration with the Department of Industrial Engineering -chemical sector, of the University of Padova [13]. The IPEM laboratory in Belgium represents the ideal environment to carry out research on how people engage with artistic installation and to observe their modes of interaction with technological systems. On-going research at IPEM involves bio-sensors and motion capture systems, allowing for quantitative measurements of parameters (mainly related to body movements and gestures) that relate to the aesthetic experience of interaction. The creation of \"preservation (or archive) copies\" of multimedia interactive installations requires the definition of paradigms and concepts to deal with the complexity of the technology involved in art making, as well as a deeper understanding of how interaction really happens and how it becomes a meaningful (aesthetic) experience for people. In order to get this understanding, the authors re-installed an artwork called BilliArT that was first presented in a public fair in Ghent in 2013 [19]. The installation is a dynamic system in which generative music and visual textures emerge from the interaction of the participants with a standard carom billiard table (Fig. 2). The importance of the experiment carried out at IPEM (December 2015, data analysis currently in process) transcends the specific results obtained form the data analysis 4 , because it is the first attempt to introduce a systematic approach into the field of installation art preservation. This field is basically unexplored and the role of academia is of paramount important in organizing and guiding the research activities. The complexity of multimedia interactive art amplifies the risks of falsifying the [documentation about the] original work, because the methods and the techniques to capture the experience have not been formalized yet. A reflection around the trustworthiness of the archival documentation for multimedia interactive installations can definitely benefit from what has been said about audio recordings, and in turn can contribute to devise better preservation models and strategies for non-artistic complex systems such as robots for Fig. 3. Test for video shooting. On the left, a correct setting of the camera: each frame is clear and the text is readable. On the right, a wrong setting of the camera. The aim is to detect physical defects of the tape (due to aging or joints) that may correspond to a specific noise in the audio signal. Audio is directly recorded from a secondary line-out of the STUDER A-810.","refs":[{"start":333,"end":337,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b17"},{"start":750,"end":754,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b12"},{"start":1685,"end":1689,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b18"},{"start":1865,"end":1866,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_1"},{"start":2038,"end":2039,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_1"},{"start":2832,"end":2833,"marker":"figure","target":null}]},{"text":"automatic music expressive performance [20] and other computer-based systems involved in scientific research.","refs":[{"start":39,"end":43,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b19"}]}]},{"title":"A Searchable Collection of Interactive Multimedia Installations","paragraphs":[{"text":"Current cataloguing standards provide that documents are classified by homogeneous types and, accordingly, that multimedia works are dismembered and their components grouped by category.

The documentary unity must be (temporarily) violated for cataloguing, and subsequently restored to re-create the aesthetic experience as a whole. This approach leads to a variety of information systems using different formats for data storage, and the low or absent interoperability among repositories makes the reconstruction of the documentary unity a problematic or impossible task.","refs":[{"start":263,"end":267,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b20"}]},{"text":"The collaboration between the IPEM center at Ghent University and the CSC in Padova aims to provide a breakthrough solution for the problem of describing, classifying and preserving interactive multimedia installations. A complete overview of the state of the art in the extra-academic field of preservation (mainly led by large museums across the world) is beyond the scope of this article. There is a number of critical points in the current preservation practices, especially in the long-term and from the viewpoint of digital philology. One critical point that is being overlooked is the lack of a searchable database of interactive multimedia installations. In a world where searching texts, images and music by keyword (or occasionally by content) is a given fact, the impossibility to browse collections of interactive multimedia installations by characterising features (degree and mode of interaction, type of sensors involved, etc.) seems anachronistic. The on-going research at IPEM and CSC aims to define what these features may be, in order to achieve a formalization that will bring about a whole new way of grouping, approaching and studying interactive multimedia installations.","refs":[]}]},{"title":"Conclusions","paragraphs":[{"text":"Much research conducted in the field of computer science is preparatory to other scientific fields, such as (ethno-)musicology, linguistics and anthropology, mainly with methods and tools (e.g., information retrieval, signal processing, data compression).
