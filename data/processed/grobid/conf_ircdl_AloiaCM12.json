In a well-known paper [3] Tim Berners-Lee, coined the term Semantic Web which advocated to extend the web of documents as \"a web of data that can be processed directly and indirectly by machines\", with the ability of discovering new resources through the interconnection of similar data. The Europeana project goal is to provide integrated access to digital objects from the cultural heritage organizations of all the nations of the European Union. To achieve this objective, Europeana provides a set of tools, such as the portal, a set of APIs for programmatic access to its resources, etc. Having the ability to provide metadata as Linked Open Data, is very important for Europeana to attract new users and new providers because the linked data paradigm enables the use of digital representations of cultural artifacts for generating knowledge [7]. For this reason, the implementation of Linked Open Data Pilot Server (LODPS) is an important step for Europeana, its partners and third parties. It paves the way towards achieving two crucial Europeana targets: enable connecting related data and makes them easily accessible using common Web technologies and enable everyone to access, reuse, enrich and share data.","refs":[{"start":128,"end":131,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b0"},{"start":155,"end":158,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b2"},{"start":979,"end":982,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b6"}]},{"text":"Distributing the whole Europeana datasets as Linked Open Data (LOD) requires to process the existing Europeana metadata, coded according to the Europeana Semantic Elements (ESE), to obtain RDF descriptions as required by Linked Data approach (ESE enrichment and transformation), and to define an agreement with every data provider to publish their data as open data.","refs":[]},{"text":"We decided to focus on finding solutions for the first issue, by creating a Linked Open Data Pilot server that exposes as Linked Data a subset of the Europeana content belonging to those providers, who want to make their data available on the web.

There are two main strategies to implement the URI dereference mechanism: 303 URIs and hash URIs, both are described in details in [6]. In summary: -In the 303 URIs strategy if the server recognizes that the URI identify a real object or an abstract concept , it sends to the client a HTTP response code \"303 See Other\" and a link to a web document describing the resource, the client then asks for this document and the server returns it with HTTP code \"200\" -In the hash URIs strategy the fragment identifier of a URI (the part of a URI that follows the # symbol) is used to identify real-world objects and abstract concepts, without creating ambiguity.","refs":[{"start":568,"end":571,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b5"}]},{"text":"Advantages and disadvantages of both strategies are discussed in [6]; in essence: hash URIs have the advantage of reducing the number of necessary HTTP connections, which, in turn, reduces access latency, 303 URIs, on the other hand, is more flexible because the redirection target can be configured separately for each resource.","refs":[{"start":65,"end":68,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b5"}]},{"text":"For the Europeana LD server we decided to adopt the 303 URIs strategy, the main reasons for this choice are explained in the following paragraph.","refs":[]}]},{"title":"4","paragraphs":[{"text":"The Europeana Linked Data server","refs":[]},{"text":"The following picture, taken from [2], shows the overall architecture of the Europeana Linked Data server.","refs":[{"start":34,"end":37,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b1"}]},{"text":"According to the publishing steps individuated in [1] we can describe the server as follows:","refs":[{"start":50,"end":53,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b0"}]},{"text":"-Data preparation: this step is executed by three server components.

A detailed description of the algorithms and tools implementing these components can be found in [2]. The output of this step consists of a number of RDF triples (currently: 115.769.306) that are stored a) in a set of dump files, b) in an RDF-Store.

On the contrary the response time for queries to the RDF Store is very critical since every data resource in the store is accessed via query. Results presented in [8], where performances and features the main RDF Store are compared, shows that the Virtuoso server is a good solution from the performance point of view.

The current activity on the Europena Linked Data pilot has three main goals: to increase the number of the Europeana content providers contributing to the Europeana Linked Data dataset, to refine the dataset quality by adding links to other Linked Data sets and to improve the implementation of the server functionalities. Concerning this last activity probably the biggest challenge is to improve the Data Store performances. Even if the Virtuoso Server query response time is acceptable for a pilot server, we're working to identify a solution applicable in a 'production' server, when potentially the whole Europeana Dataset could be published as Open Data.
