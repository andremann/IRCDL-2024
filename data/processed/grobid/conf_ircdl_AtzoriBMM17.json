Its mission is to foster an Open Science e-Infrastructure that links people, ideas and resources for the free flow, access, sharing, and re-use of research outcomes, services and processes for the advancement of research and the dissemination of scientific knowledge. OpenAIRE operates an open, collaborative, service oriented infrastructure that supports (i) the realization of a pan-European network for the definition, promotion and implementation of shared interoperability guidelines and best practices for managing, sharing, re-using, and preserving research outcomes of different typologies; (ii) the promotion of Open Science policies and practices at all stages of the research life-cycle and across research communities belonging to different application domains and geographical areas; (iii) the provision of measurements of the impact of Open Science and the return of investment of national and international funding agencies; (iv) the development and operation of a technical infrastructure supporting services for the discovery of and access to research outcomes via a centralized entry point, where research outcomes are enriched with contextual information via links to objects relevant to the research life-cycle. This paper focuses on the workflows operated by the OpenAIRE technical infrastructure for the management of the OpenAIRE information space. The OpenAIRE technical infrastructure includes services dedicated to the aggregation of information about objects of the research life-cycle. In order to help repository managers to integrate their data with OpenAIRE, the guidelines (https:// guidelines.openaire.eu) describe how to expose such information (publications, datasets, CRIS metadata) via the OAI-PMH protocol. Relationships between objects are collected from the data sources, but also automatically detected by inference algorithms [1] and added by users, who can insert links between publications, datasets and projects via the claiming procedure available from the OpenAIRE web portal. The Information Space is available for human and machine consumption via the OpenAIRE web portal and different kinds of APIs. Among the challenges emerging in this scenario, one is relative to the orchestration of the different workflows characterizing the OpenAIRE system. In fact, a key factor for its sustainability is represented by the system capability of being autonomic and extensible, i.e. the possibility to easily define and implement autonomous workflows. The OpenAIRE workflows orchestration is delegated to D-NET, a software toolkit for constructing and operating aggregative infrastructures in a cost-effective way as instances of service-oriented data infra-structures [6].","refs":[{"start":76,"end":79,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b2"},{"start":79,"end":81,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b3"},{"start":1951,"end":1954,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b0"},{"start":2792,"end":2795,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b5"}]},{"text":"Outline.

By searching, browsing, and post processing the graph, funders can find the information they require to evaluate research impact (i.e. return on investment, RoI) at the level of grants and funding schemes, organized by disciplines and access rights, while scientists can find the Open Access versions of scientific trends of interest. The ISG is then made available for programmatic access via several APIs (Search HTTP APIs, OAI-PMH, and Linked Open Data), for search, browse and statistics consultation via the OpenAIRE portal, and soon for data sources with the Literature Broker Service [8]. The graph data model is inspired by the standards for research data description and research management (e.g. organizations, projects, facilities) description provided by DataCite and CERIF, respectively.

This association plays a crucial role in the inference workflow as it determines the possibility to correctly associate the inference results produced by mining a given full-text, to the corresponding object in the OpenAIRE ISG. While in case of metadata records describing publications the aggregation system can rely on well-established formats and exchange protocols such as Dublin Core [7] and OAI-PMH [8] respectively, in case of full-text files the aggregation system often needs to crawl the landing page referred in a metadata record to discover the link to the actual file.

The idea is that publications whose keys fall in the same cluster are more likely to be similar than across different clusters. This action narrows down the number of pairwise matches to perform within the clusters of publications, thereby reducing the complexity of the problem. Ideally, the definition of a good clustering function for de-duplication should avoid false negatives (i.e. making sure that obvious duplicates fall in the same cluster), avoid false positives (i.e. making sure that clearly different publications do not fall in the same cluster), and make the number of matches to be tractable for the technology at hand. The definition of a good clustering function for de-duplication of publications starts from the properties available in the publications metadata. From the analysis of the publication properties, the only always present and informative enough is the title. Clustering publications starting from their title may be done according to different strategies, which avoid or tolerate minor differences in the values, typically caused by typos or the partial or full presence of words. Some examples are: removing stop words, blank spaces, etc.; lower-casing all words; using combination of prefixes or postfixes of title words; using n-grams of relevant words; using hashing functions. Using any of these strategies has implications that depend on the features of titles in the ISG. For example, the heavy presence of short titles (consisting at most of a few short words) may find in the hashing function a better solution than using prefixes of words. On the other hand, the adoption of high performance technologies may allow for a greedier approach, which allows for more matches to be performed hence avoid false negatives.","refs":[]},{"text":"The OpenAIRE ISG is very heterogeneous as both data sources and disciplines behind publications are of different kinds. As a consequence, the preferred approach is the one that combines the first letters of words (like an acronym) into a clustering key and the last letters of words into another clustering key. The approach is quite typo-safe and proves to exclude the majority of false negatives, on the other hand it includes false positives, which shall be excluded with the subsequent detailed similarity match.","refs":[]}]},{"title":"Candidate Matching","paragraphs":[{"text":"The method described above is well known in record linkage literature as Blocking. It is well suited to address the de-duplication problem in large datasets [14,15], and to further narrow the number of pairwise comparisons can be followed by the so-called Sliding Window method. The sliding window is based on the idea that publications in the cluster are ordered according to a defined function, to maximize the probability that similar publications are as close as possible. Publications in the cluster are then pairwise matched only if they are part of the same sliding window of length K. When all the publications have been matched, the sliding window is moved to the next element of the ordering and a new set of pairs is matched. Sliding windows introduce false negatives, since they exclude from the match publications in the same cluster, but control performance (especially in terms of memory and execution time) by setting an upper bound to the number of matches in each cluster. In order to define a solid candidate matching function, we need to identify which properties are most influential in the matching process, i.e. those that best contribute to establish publication equivalence introducing lower computational cost, while allowing clear cut decisions, and are often present in the publications. As in the previous phase of candidate identification, the title is again a good choice: it is present in (almost) all objects and consists of a relatively short text, which can be fast and reliably processed by known string matching functions. In general, if the titles of two publications are not similar \"enough\" (according to a given threshold) then no other property-to-property match may revise this decision. Conversely, sufficient similarity in titles (or even equivalence) alone is not enough as one of the following cases may occur: (i) very short titles, composed of few, commonly used words may lead to obvious equivalence; e.g. the title \"Report on the project XYZ\" may be recurrent, the only difference being the name \"XYZ\" of the project; (ii) recurrent titles; e.g. the title \"Introduction\" of some chapters is very common and introduces ambiguity in the decision, and (iii) presence of numbers in titles of different published works; e.g. the title \"A Cat's perspective of the Mouse\" is likely referring to a publication different from \"A Cat's perspective of the Mouse v2\", but not different from \"A Cat perspective of the Mouse\"; As a consequence, the decision process must be supported by further matches that may strengthen the final conclusion, possibly based on one or more of the following publication properties: author names, date of acceptance, abstract, language, subjects, PID. Those are all features that could contribute to the matching on different levels, however their contribution mostly depends on data quality. In OpenAIRE case, PIDs are significantly contributing to the matching process. Unluckily they are present only in a subpart of our publication objects (between 30-40%), but on the bright side they contribute allowing to take strong decisions on the equivalence of two publications: if two publications provide the same DOI they are indeed duplicates. Therefore, a similarity function, based on the availability of certain properties can take straightforward decisions on equivalence or difference between publications, while in other cases can only come up with a rank of confidence that depends on the availability and weights of the properties above.","refs":[{"start":157,"end":161,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b13"},{"start":161,"end":164,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b14"}]}]},{"title":"Graph Disambiguation","paragraphs":[{"text":"Duplicate identification terminates providing a set of pairs of duplicate publications. In order to disambiguate the ISG, duplicates should be hidden and replaced by a \"representative object\" that links to the duplicates it represents (and vice versa). The representative publication becomes the hub of all incoming and outgoing relationships relative to the publications it hides. As a result, the graph is disambiguated but still keeps track of its original topology, hence allowing data managers to measure the duplicates percentage for a given data source. The graph disambiguation phase consists of two steps: duplicates grouping and duplicates merging. Grouping duplicates requires the identification of the connected components formed by the equivalence relationships identified by duplicate identification. Merging the groups of duplicates requires instead the creation of a representative publication for each connected component (or group of duplicates) and the propagation towards this new object of all incoming and outgoing relationships of the object it merges. Both actions have serious performance implications, which depend on the topology of the graph (e.g. fragmentation and density of graph, edge distance of publications in the graph, number of the duplicates). For example, the number of duplicated publications depends on the replication of the publication across different data sources, e.g. institutional repository of the author, thematic repository, and a number of aggregators, but it is in general not very high (e.g. co-authors, each depositing in their respective institutional repositories which are in turn harvested by OpenAIRE).","refs":[]}]},{"title":"Information Inference Workflow","paragraphs":[{"text":"The OpenAIRE information inference system (IIS) is based on an instantiation of the Information Inference Framework (IIF) [1]. The IIS is responsible for enriching the ISG with new information produced by various types of data mining algorithms. The inference workflow has been designed to work on a snapshot of the entire ISG, in this sense the IIS is a stateless subsystem, whose outcome can be regenerated from scratch on each run. Each IIS inference algorithm is associated to an Action Set, i.e. a logical container that stores and versions the inference results. Such results consist of new objects (publications and datasets), new properties that enrich existing objects (such as document classification properties and citation lists), and semantically typed relationships among objects in the ISG. The IIS results versioning supported by Action Sets allows, in case of regressions in one or more mining algorithms, to reuse previously generated results without requiring to (i) rollback an algorithm to one of its previous versions, (ii) reintegrate it in the IIS, (iii) re-execute it to obtain consistent results. The inference workflow has been divided in two distinct phases: pre-processing and primary. The pre-processing phase supports the implementation of the OpenAIRE acquisition policy [12], according to which (i) a non-Open Access publication can be included into the ISG if it is funded by a project already in OpenAIRE; (ii) a dataset can be included into the ISG only if it is related to a publication already in OpenAIRE. To this aim the pre-processing phase includes the algorithms tailored to infer links between publications and projects, and between publications and datasets. The IIS main phase instead, operates over the ISG and executes all the full-text mining algorithms described in the Table 1 below, which summarizes the inference results produced in November 2016. The result of the workflows described in previous sections (content aggregation, ISG population, de-duplication and inference) are materialized by the data publishing workflow into four ISG projections: (i) a full-text index to support search and browse queries from the OpenAIRE Web portal and to expose subsets of the ISG on the OpenAIRE search API, (ii) a E-R database and a dedicated key-value cache for statistics, (iii) a NoSQL document storage in order to support OAI-PMH bulk export of subsets of the ISG in XML format, and finally (iv) a triple store in order to expose the ISG as LOD via a SPARQL endpoint. Every time the data publishing workflow executes, four new ISG projections are generated and persisted in a \"pre-public status\" before being accessible from the general public. The switch from pre-public to public, meaning that the currently accessible ISG projections and statistics will be dismissed and the new versions will take their place, is still manual for safety reasons. Whenever new pre-public ISG projections (pre-public ISG) are created, it is important to verify some constrains in order to evaluate whether the switch to public can be performed or some regressions in the overall data quality needs to be addressed first. Some constraints to be ensured regard the control of quality metrics extracted from the different projections of the ISG and may involve one or more projections (e.g. threshold checks, alignment of different ISG projections); other conditions regard instead the trend throughout time of such quality metrics (e.g. whether a certain trend is monotonic increasing/decreasing or not) and may involve one or more trends extracted from different projections.","refs":[{"start":122,"end":125,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b0"},{"start":1303,"end":1307,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b11"},{"start":1826,"end":1827,"marker":"table","target":"#tab_0"}]},{"text":"The number of quality metrics that has to be extracted to ensure the quality of the ISG is large (about a hundred metrics) and cannot be covered here for the sake of brevity.
