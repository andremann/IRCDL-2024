While the third paradigm gave rise to computational sciences (e.g., computational biology), the fourth one is at the basis of science informatics (e.g., bioinformatics).

An opposite methodological approach is proposed by the fourth paradigm: Algorithms are applied to find new working hypotheses through the discovery of 'patterns' directly inferred from large databases. For instance, groups ('clusters') of 'similar' poems might be identified in digital libraries or archaeological collections, or in literary corpora, and suggest new hypotheses on which an enquiry using traditional approaches can be started.","refs":[]},{"text":"This paper presents an application of the fourth paradigm for allowing scholars to query and search large digital libraries of manuscripts using ICRPad, a patented digital recognition system.

A low value determines a complete, but quite slow search; the higher the value, the faster the search, but at the expenses of completeness (i.e., an occurrence of the model might not be found even if it is visible in the image); • overlap: specifies how two graphic regions may overlap an image; in case of symmetry, the allowed overlap should be reduced to prevent multiple matches on the same object; • sub-pixel: determines accuracy by selecting the precision in calculating the position, orientation and scale; default definitions may be provided for these features, such as calculation of position, which can be determined with precision 'pixels' only, while accuracy of orientation and scale is respectively equal to values of angle and of scale size specified during the construction of the model; in this way, the position is estimated with accuracy at pixel level, and the size of the object determines the accuracy of estimated scale and orientation: the larger the size, the more precise the orientation and scale; • deformation: sometimes, the objects are either not found at all or found with a low precision degree only, because they are slightly deformed compared to the model. In these cases, it is possible to use a deformation parameter that expresses how many pixels of deviation are tolerated from the edges found in the image to those of the model shape. The value of this parameter should be set as small as possible, using a high value only for targeted searches. Indeed, the higher this value, the greater the risk of finding wrong model instances; moreover, a high value for this parameter often produces an increase in processing time; both problems mainly stem from the search of small/fine/thin structured objects, because these kind of objects, when undergoing further deformation, lose their characteristic shape, which is important for an effective search.","refs":[]}]},{"title":"Searching Shape Model","paragraphs":[{"text":"The position and rotation of the found instances are returned as row, column and angle values. Moreover, each instance found is marked by a score. Additional information is returned, such as scale: if the shape model is creating, the resolution ratio between the model and the found image is parameterized. Downsampling can be enabled to speed up the matching process, i.e., images at lower resolution can be used. The set of images at different resolutions representing the same source image, ordered by decreasing resolution, is called a pyramid, and the images in a pyramid are the pyramid levels, where the top of the pyramid is the image at the lowest resolution. When defining a model, a set of images having different resolution is created. So, the model is created and searched on multiple pyramid levels (images). The number of levels of the pyramid to be used can be specified: it is a good practice to choose the highest level of the pyramid with models containing at least 10 to 15 pixels and such that the shape model still resembles the shape of the object. However, the system provides primitives that allow the user to automatically set these parameters by an internal analysis of the region covered by the model.","refs":[]}]},{"title":"Experimental Results","paragraphs":[{"text":"The full matching process of ICRPad was tested on about 3500 images belonging to 7 medioeval latin manuscripts dated between the XI and XIII Centuries, all of unknown -but seemingly different -authors and scriptoria.","refs":[]},{"text":"The graph \"&\" was used as a sample of this first experiment, because it was distinctive of all researched manuscripts.","refs":[]},{"text":"Before starting the matching process, we created the shape model.

Surprisingly, we knew that really these were written either by the same hand or by the same scriptorium.

It means that the system does not deal with a single, specific, pre-defined database, but it can be connected in real time to several databases available on-line. The user will select one of them as relevant to his research objectives. After selecting the databases, the user chooses the image(s) that will provide the models to be searched. Then, he creates the shape models for his search and, by using them, he queries the connected databases. In the classical setting, he starts from a search hypothesis and checks whether the query results may confirm it. In the new setting we envisage, he may also issue a random search, i.e., without any expectation on the results, and draw inspiration to build new research hypotheses from the very search results. Finally, he might query the databases with a research hypothesis in mind, but in addition to the True Positive outcomes, he may also carefully analyze False Positive outcomes: the latter, in facts, may be of great interest, because some of them, albeit different than the model, may nevertheless reveal similarities that suggest the scholar interesting hypotheses to be investigated. This is a data science approach to the consultation of databases, and opens new frontiers to the study of data humanities. We show this with the following sample scenario. We tested ICRPad working with a scholar involved in paleographic and historical studies on handwritten codices. He aims at exploring new research hypotheses concerning his domain of interest. To this purpose, he chooses to query some existing on-line databases in order to collect useful hints for his research inspired by the results of his queries. Using ICRPad, he connects to a registered on-line database (e.g., the digital library of The British Library), because he wants to explore two manuscripts included in a famous codex (let us call them \"ms A\" and \"ms B\"), that are generally considered in the literature as written by different writers. He aims at checking whether there is some chance that, using the matching algorithm, the alternate graphs, on which the claim that the two writers are different is based, have in fact sufficient similarity to be considered as written by the same writer. In real time, he connects to the repository in which the codex is stored, chooses at random a page image from one of the two manuscripts under consideration (say, ms A), and from this image he selects the greek alphabet glyph ψ as Region of Interest (ROI). Then, he proceeds by creating from the ROI the shape model to search using the \"create model\" tool. He saves the shape model just created in his personal system repository, then he runs the \"find\" functionality. The system scans the whole codex and returns all occurrences that fulfil the parameters, and thus are considered equal or similar to the shape models he created. He gets the following results:","refs":[]},{"text":"• ms A, glyph ψ:","refs":[]},{"text":"-True Positives (homograph of psi): 75% (50% in ms A, 25% in ms B) -False Positives: 25% (10% in ms A, 15% in ms B); among which: glyphs nearly homograph of ψ: 20% (5% in ms A, 15% in ms B), all referred to glyph ψ, whose strokes perfectly overlap the corresponding traits of ψ; glyphs approximately homograph: 5% (all in ms B), all glyphs υ, some traits of whose curved lines can be overlapped to the corresponding traits of ψ.","refs":[]},{"text":"The True Positive results, albeit uncertain, could be somewhat expected by the user when issuing his search, but might also have been insufficient, alone, to back the hypothesis that the same writer wrote both manuscripts. On the other hand, False Positive results, albeit unexpected, may be even more important, because they turn out to be in many traits totally homograph to the model. In such a case, an item that would normally be considered as a noisy result, may be interpreted as a further confirmation that both manuscripts were made by the same writer. In turn, this stimulates additional investigation on both the digital and the physical artifact, and becomes the starting point for a new hypothesis about the authorship of the two manuscripts. E.g., contrary to what was claimed and believed along many years of literature, it suggests that the two manuscripts were actually manufactured by the same person, operating in one scriptorium or, in different moments, in several scriptoria that used exactly the same \"canone\". Another possibility is that the \"canone\" stayed unchanged during one or two centuries in the same scriptorium or in different scriptoria in the same geographic area, and that it was used according to strict, precise rules by different writers.","refs":[]}]},{"title":"Conclusion","paragraphs":[{"text":"In this paper we outlined the features of ICRPad, a patented graphic matching system for the digital recognition of manuscripts, and proposed a new approach to searching and retrieving information in digital libraries.
