Researchers run their digital experiments (e.g. simulations, data analysis) taking advantage of the digital laboratory assets (e.g. RStudio2 , Jupyter Notebook3 , Taverna workbench 4 ) and generate new research data and computational products (e.g. software, R algorithms, computational workflows) that can be shared with other researchers of the same community, that can be discovered, accessed and reused and ultimately can become part of the e-infrastructure.","refs":[{"start":817,"end":818,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_0"},{"start":837,"end":838,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_1"},{"start":859,"end":860,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_2"}]},{"text":"The role of digital laboratories is therefore twofold: on the one hand they support researchers in their advancement of science, offering the facilities needed for their daily activities; on the other hand, they foster the dissemination of research within the research community, supporting discovery, access to, sharing, and reuse of digital research products. In fact, their digital nature offers unprecedented opportunities for scientists, who can share not only scientific literature describing their findings, but also the digital results that they produced, together with the digital laboratory itself. Those features are fundamental for an effective implementation of the Open Science (OS) paradigm [1,2]. OS is a set of practices of science, advocated by scientific/scholarly communication stakeholders (i.e., research funders 5 , research and academic organisations, and researchers), according to which a research activity (intended as an activity performed to answer a research question) and all the generated products should be freely available, under terms that enable their findability, accessibility, re-use, and re-distribution [3].","refs":[{"start":706,"end":709,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b0"},{"start":709,"end":711,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b1"},{"start":835,"end":836,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_3"},{"start":1144,"end":1147,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b2"}]},{"text":"If supported with adequate degrees of openness, scientists would find the conditions to repeat (\"same research activity, same laboratory\"), replicate (\"same research activity, different laboratory\"), reproduce (\"same research activity, different input parameters\"), or re-use (\"using a product into another research activity\") the results of research activities, thereby maximizing transparency and exploitation of scientific findings [4].","refs":[{"start":435,"end":438,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b3"}]},{"text":"The ability to share research products, in combination with digital laboratories, opens the way to Open Science principles.

In other words, scientists should, as much as possible, make their methodologies, thinking and findings available to enable/maximize collaboration and reuse by the community. The digital laboratory becomes therefore the core of this vision as it is the place providing the assets needed by the researchers to implement their research flow (i.e. the actual sequence of experiments required to prove the initial thesis) and at the same time the place providing the generated research products, for sharing and peer-reviewing. For example, scientists performing analysis of data using R scripts, may use a digital laboratory equipped with the software RStudio offered as-a-service by an online provider (e.g. BlueBridge e-infrastructure powered by D4Science6 ) and a repository where they can store/share their R scripts and their input and output datasets (e.g. Zenodo.org).","refs":[{"start":1001,"end":1002,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_4"}]},{"text":"In the following we shall refer to the following concepts:","refs":[]},{"text":"â€¢ A research activity is performed to answer a \"research question\", usually formulated as one or more hypotheses to be proved true; â€¢ A research flow is made of a number of experiments, realized as sequence of steps in the context of a digital laboratory, executed by scientists driven by the ultimate intent of proving an initial scientific thesis; â€¢ An experiment is a goal-driven sequence of steps set to verify a thesis, and whose result may inspire further experiments to address the target of the overarching research activity. One experiment can be constituted of several series of sequential steps executed in parallel. â€¢ A digital laboratory is a pool of digital assets (e.g. on-line tools, desktop tools, methodologies, standards) used by scientists to perform the steps of an experiment and generate research products. â€¢ A research product is any digital object generated during the research flow that was relevant to complete the research activity and (possibly) relevant for its interpretation once the research activity has been completed.

The researcher then interprets the model and produces the scientific article to be published. In this (simplified) example both the generated model and the article are research products that can be shared and peer-reviewed. The configuration of the application used for generating a model could also be made available, to increase transparency and replicability. In a more complete scenario, the research flow could include several repetitions of the model generation, with different input parameters or with different equations, until the interpretation of the generated model would satisfy the researcher. This article presents the foundations of a framework for the representation of research flows in support of peer review for a given discipline of science. The aim of the framework is to enable research communities to formally define research flow patterns that define which are the steps that should be peer-reviewed. Such a framework may become the scaffolding enabling the development of tools for supporting ongoing peer review of research flows. Such tools could be \"hooked\", in real time, to the underlying digital laboratory, where scientists are carrying out their research flow, and they would abstract over the complexity of the research activity and offer user-friendly dashboards to examine the adopted scientific process, explore the ongoing research flow, and evaluate its intermediate experiments and products.","refs":[]},{"text":"Outline.

Research publishing is generally intended as the moment in which researchers share their findings with the broader community of all researchers, hence also the moment at which the peer review of the research flow starts, assuming that the published material somehow \"represents\" the whole research flow. Traditionally, the peer review of the research flow has been delegated to scientific literature (e.g., articles, books, technical reports, PhD theses) which is still regarded as the common omni-comprehensive unit of scientific dissemination. The published material provides the means for the review of the research flow (and possibly reproducibility) by explaining and describing the different steps, the digital laboratory where they were conducted (i.e., methodology, tools, standards, etc.), and describing any product used or yielded by the research activity, thus facilitating reproducibility by a detailed, theoretically unambiguous, description of the experiments. However, a natural language description of a methodology can have different interpretations and typically does not include all the details that are needed in order to replicate the experiment or reproduce the results. In addition, it has been found [5][6][7] that \"methodology\" sections of many papers often include generic sentences, and lack the details that would be necessary to attempt the reproduction of the results. To overcome this issue, the Centre for Open Science, in collaboration with more than 3,000 journals, is testing the approach of \"pre-registered reports\", i.e. documents that describe the research flow in a structured and detailed form and that are submitted to the journal before the research starts [8].","refs":[{"start":1357,"end":1360,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b4"},{"start":1360,"end":1363,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b5"},{"start":1363,"end":1366,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b6"},{"start":1832,"end":1835,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b7"}]},{"text":"To overcome the drawbacks of publishing only scientific literature, a common approach adopted today across several disciplines is that of publishing articles together with links to other digital products of the research, deposited in dedicated repositories.

Data repositories typically implement data review processes that focus on checking the technical details of the datasets, validating their metadata and, possibly, their descriptions, without addressing the scientific value of the dataset itself.

The peer review of data papers is mostly focused on the review of metadata, whose completeness and clarity are considered fundamental to facilitate data re-use [12][13][14]. With the existing approaches, the reproducibility of a dataset (when applicable, as some datasets cannot be reproduced, such as those generated by devices for atmospheric measurements) is not considered an important aspect of data (peer) review, although reproducibility is crucial to demonstrate the correctness of data and its analysis, upon which researchers' conclusions are based.","refs":[{"start":69,"end":73,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b10"},{"start":501,"end":505,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b11"},{"start":505,"end":509,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b12"},{"start":509,"end":513,"marker":"bibr","target":null}]},{"text":"In addition to the publishing of research data, researchers started to publish also their computational products, such as software, R algorithms, computational workflows.

Research is still peer-reviewed out of its original context (the digital laboratory) and the concepts of machine-assisted peer-review and ongoing peer-review are not being considered. It would be desirable to have tools for machine-assisted peer-review, built on the very same digital laboratory assets that were used to generated the research products. Although humans would still play a central role in the peer-review process with regards to the evaluation of novelty and impact of a research flow and its final products, such tools would support reviewers facing challenges going beyond their capabilities, like checking the quality of each record in a database, or the conformance to structural and semantic requirements [18]. The ultimate goal should be that of an ongoing peer review of the research flow. In contrast with traditional peer review models, which assess scientific results only once the research activity has been successfully completed, ongoing peer review could also be applied as a sort of monitoring and interim evaluation process. The sharing of intermediate research flow experiments and steps would open up the possibility of publishing negative results.

Reproducibility can be objectively supported by a machine and finally evaluated, but the assessment of methodology as a whole still depends on humans. We propose a framework in support of the peer-review of the research flow. The framework is built around the notion of research flow templates. These are representations of the scientific processes in terms of patterns (sequences and cycles) of experiments and relative steps to be peer reviewed. Note that such templates should include only the experiments and steps that are relevant for peer-reviewing the research flow, including their inputs and outputs. In other words, research flow templates are not intended to describe the detailed experiments and steps of a research activity (as would be the case for reproducibility), but are intended to model the subset of actions that are relevant to assess the quality of the research flow.","refs":[]}]},{"title":"Concepts of the Framework","paragraphs":[{"text":"In order for a research community to provide specifications for the peer-reviewable parts of its research flow and be able to build adequate tools in support of reviewers, a simple formal framework capable of describing the structure of the templates for that community should be available. Each template should reflect one particular way of performing science, capturing the steps which should be subject to peer review (a community may have more than one template). At the same time, templates help researchers to comply with certain rules and expectations when producing science. Templates express common behaviour, determine good practices, facilitate reproducibility and transparent evaluation of science. To make an analogy, the structure of a fully-fledged template should reflect the structure of a recipe for cooking. It should specify a list of all the types of products needed from the digital laboratory at each step of the research flow (the ingredients) and should provide a detailed description, possibly machine actionable, of all the steps to be executed (the mixing and the cooking) in order to obtain the research results (the cake).","refs":[]},{"text":"A research flow review framework should encompass the following concepts (see Fig. 3):","refs":[{"start":83,"end":84,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_3"}]},{"text":"â€¢ Research flow template: the model of research flow to be followed by scientists in terms of experiments, including cycles, conditions, etc. to be peer reviewed; â€¢ Signatures of steps and experiment, intended as:","refs":[]},{"text":"-The types of input and output products (e.g. datasets, computational products, documentation, scientific articles); -Asset of the digital laboratory (which is not necessary a research product) required for the execution of the step or of the experiment (e.g. tool, service, application); -For experiments: the format in which the experiment will be digitally represented and shared with peers.

That practice is a prerequisite for reaching two of the main goals of the Open Science movement: reproducibility and transparent assessment of research activities. In this paper we have described the current practices for the peer review of research flows, which range from traditional peer-review via scientific literature to peer review by reproducibility of digital experiments. We have argued that current practices have reproducibility of science as their main objective and they do not fully address transparent assessment and its features like publishing negative results, supporting peer-review while the research activities are ongoing and enabling machine-assisted peer review.","refs":[]},{"text":"Foundations of a framework for the peer-review of research flows have been presented. The goal of the framework is to be the bridge between the place where the research is conducted (i.e., the digital laboratory) and the place where the research is published (or in general, made available and accessible). The framework aims at providing the scaffolding on top of which reviewers can evaluate science by means of a user-friendly environment that transparently relies on the underlying digital laboratory assets, hides their ICT complexity, and gives guarantees of repeatability and reproducibility recognized by the community. One of the building blocks of the framework is the notion of research flow template, through which a community can model the research flow to be followed by scientists in terms of experiments, including cycles, conditions, etc. to be peer reviewed. The framework allows communities to define one or more research flow templates, each capturing the steps which should be subject to peer review for a specific type of research activity. Templates are not only useful to peers willing to evaluate a research activity, but also enforce researchers at complying with certain expectations of their community, like best practices and common behaviour.","refs":[]},{"text":"The framework is theoretically applicable to any field of research adopting digital objects and/or producing digital research outputs.

The adoption of ICT technologies in support of science introduces new opportunities to support transparent evaluation, thanks to the possibility of sharing research products, even inputs, intermediate and negative results, repetition and reproduction of the research activities conducted in a digital laboratory. Such innovative shift also sets the condition for novel peer review methodologies, as well as scientific reward policies, where scientific results can be transparently and objectively assessed via machine-assisted processes. This paper presents the foundations of a framework for the representation of a peer-reviewable research flow for a given discipline of science. Such a framework may become the scaffolding enabling the development of tools for supporting ongoing peer review of research flows. Such tools could be \"hooked\", in real time, to the underlying digital laboratory, where scientists are carrying out their research flow, and they would abstract over the complexity of the research activity and offer user-friendly dashboards.","refs":[]}]}}
