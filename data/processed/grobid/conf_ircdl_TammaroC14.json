It also appears that regardless of the origin and the intended fruition of the digital resource, large segments of its life cycle are more or less the same in each of the three traditional disciplines of libraries, archives and museums. Of course, given the different focus and mission of the three disciplines, the value adding and the access portions of the life cycle will remain different, but we believe that further collaboration for the development of a common curriculum in digital curation can be built upon the many similarities over the entire life cycle.","refs":[]},{"text":"At the same time, as it could be expected, the three research questions mentioned at the beginning remain largely unanswered.
