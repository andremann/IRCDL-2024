In July 2009 the Ministry of Education and Research has for the first time allocated funds to the universities referring in part to the VTR (Triennial Evaluation of Research), the first national research assessment exercise which ended in 2007 (Baccini, 2010).

This is coherent with the prevalent definition of \"scientific base\" which, as was noted by the CUN (National Unversity Council 2010), essentially rests upon the affiliation and consensus of a particular scientific community. One problem in evaluation based upon peer review is that this can be based upon \"subjective\" judgments, not avoiding conservative and corporate trends. Peer review also hinges upon the publishing system of scientific publications, which is completely controlled by commercial publishers, who have assumed the role of guarantors for the quality of academic publications. The accreditation of quality is done by publishers through the publishing process: the commercial publishers have the monopoly of the peer review, also if the reviewers are scholars in public institutions. The current evaluation procedure established by ANVUR (National Agency Evaluation of the University Research), continues to base itself upon peer review (effected by Experts Group Evaluation -GEV) but, in order to limit the risks of quality evaluation based upon peer review, it has added bibliometric indicators, such as h-Index and Impact Factor, to have \"objective\" evaluation tools for publications produced in the humanities. The ANVUR procedure however continues to consider the publisher as the only referent for the quality of the editorial flow of the scientific publications. The peer review and the impact indicators are indeed not so different as many declare: both are based on the same closed scholarly community and continue to focus on traditional publications channels.","refs":[]},{"text":"Scholarly communication is however using alternative publishing models using the Internet as main communication channel.

The digital publications are hypertextual, dynamic, easily accessible, can be open and are re-usable. Digital publications do not necessarily follow a process entirely managed by the editor: many are made available in Open Access modes, in institutional repositories of universities, on the university department Web sites, in Open Access journals, in University series which are only available online.

The best known are the bibliometric indicators, and among these, the most used are the citational indicators (Impact Factor, H-Index and its variants, Eigenfactor etc.). Bibliometric measures are methodologies widely used in the field of hard sciences, also if sometimes abused, and criticized for this.

Moreover in the Humanities the Impact Factor is never calculated.","refs":[]},{"text":"Due to the specific characteristics of digital publications, the evaluation procedure of digital publications have stimulated the development and experimentation of a transparent, open and collective quality evaluation, which combines qualitative and quantitative systems evidencing the scientific base of digital content (Tammaro 2001;Reale 2008;Guerrini 2009; O Rieger 2010). Some tools that are based on the analysis of citations have been applied to the humanities as for example: SCImago. (2007). SJR1 -SCImago Journal & Country Rank is being developed by a consortium of Spanish universities (Granada, and Madrid Alcal Charles III). It 's based on data from Elsevier's Scopus database combined with the algorithm of Google's page rank. It can get a list in order of importance (visibility) of the periodic and partner countries. Lat-index2 focuses on the scientific journals of Spain, Portugal and Latin America. The basic idea is to have a unique system for evaluating scientific journals regardless of the medium with the addition of some specific indicators for electronic journals. The consortium that runs it has produced research for the e-book and electronic publications in Open Access. For the comparison of large amounts of data, as for the evaluation of departments and universities, the bibliometric systems have interesting results. In 2006 the network Publish or Perish (PoP) started to offer access to a free-ware program developed by Anne-Wil Harzing, Professor of International Management at the University of Melbourne, Australia (www.harzing.com). Based on Google Scholar, this program provides in a few seconds the main bibliometric variables in all major fields of research, from management to the social sciences, through the \"hard\" sciences. Be considered for the evaluation of digital publishing tools that are based on specific statistical algorithms research that consider the number of accesses, downloads and views. In 2004 Alex Verstak and Anurag Acharya, two engineers working on Google have launched Google Scholar, a search engine that directs, with the agreement of the publishers, the entire text of scientific articles of a large number of scientific publications covering all disciplines. Google scholar applies the same algorithm of ranking Web pages in the work of researchers and you can then make comparisons within the same field of research. The tools of Social bookmarks such as refworks.com, zotero.org, connotea.org, mendeley.com, 2collab.com, citeulike.org, mekentosj.com, are considered as collaborative assessment tools that help in evaluation.","refs":[{"start":322,"end":336,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b23"},{"start":336,"end":347,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b20"},{"start":347,"end":360,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b9"}]},{"text":"The limitation of these tools is that we know of each Web page the number of visits but this should not be confused with the impact.

The project will plan, develope and implement, within the Knowledge Organization System (KOS) of the project, a conceptual scheme (ontology) defined in a formal way and related to the different types of digital publication in the humanities, with a particular interest in the disciplinary Area 10 and 11, compared with those of Area 9.","refs":[]},{"text":"The development phase also includes a possible formalization of DELOS/DL model, so to provide both a SPARQL endpoint, in order to allow for structured queries, and a publication of the RDF data following the Linked Data principles, in order to be included in the Linking Open Data Project Cloud (LOD), which is at the moment the most important concrete development of the Semantic Web.","refs":[]},{"text":"The project also aims to produce and distribute the following products:","refs":[]},{"text":"1. An international report on comparative analysis of the evaluation model of digital publications in the humanities in Europe; 2. An international report on the ontology of scientific communication and its application in KOS; 3. Development of open educational resources, to be used within the activities of diffusion and dissemination of research results. The proposted OER would illustrate the main typologies of electronic publications identified by the project and the characteristics of the main research metrics considered, aiming at contributing tools able to allow external user and groups the possibility of acquiring in a guided way the necessary skills for using both the theoretical and the practical tools produced.","refs":[]},{"text":"The Project is still in the development phase and not started until now, due to an obstacle which has been met. The Evaluation Committee of the Area 11 who has evaluated it, has not financed it, with the following motivation:","refs":[]},{"text":"\"This will certainly be research with a high impact, mostly on the sector of research policy and research assessment; indirectly, it may also contribute to changing publication habits. How it can be viewed from a purely scholarly perspective is less clear because research assessment, bibliometry etc. is an emerging field -the impression is that the more scholarly (and therefore complex) it gets, the less will it be useful for actual quality control\".","refs":[]},{"text":"It seems to the author that the problem with the evaluation of publications is in the present closed research community of reviewers using both the peer review and the bibliometric methodologies. Instead the Digital Humanities publications need an extended community of evaluators using open tools.","refs":[]}]},{"title":"Conclusion","paragraphs":[{"text":"This Project wants to indicate that some solutions can be found to the evaluation of digital products and publications by taking advantage of information and communication technology. In this area, in fact, the European Union countries are investing resources to improve the quality and visibility of research products. In particular, the Project considers the technologies of the Semantic Web a useful tool to facilitate the access of scholarly communities to quality research and provide expert reviewers with a tool to make more consistent and informed their decision making process, speed up the review, improve the procedures of peer review.","refs":[]},{"text":"It is important to point out how the project aims not only to identify the technologies most suitable from a technical standpoint, but the focus is on developing a series of recommendations towards organizational, legal, and training needs, to support the diffusion of Digital Humanities research in a complex environment and contrasting the trend to be refractory to innovation such as in the humanities Area in Italy. The main recommendation is the need of an open research community for the evaluation of interdisciplinary products and publications.","refs":[]},{"text":"This Project itself is a Digital Humanites project and covers both interdisciplinary dimensions. The scientific achievement is therefore twofold: on the one hand, there is the need to identify, analyze and propose, some technical solutions; on the other hand, it is an essential part to analyze and propose solutions to theoretical, organizational, educational and legislative issues to ensure a virtuous cycle of knowledge production.","refs":[]},{"text":"The Project focuses on the design, implementation and testing of some applications, each of which is used for a specific methodological approach that will produce and disseminate knowledge on the use of technology in digital products and publications in Italy and Euroepan countries and, more generally, on the relationship between technology and organization of scholarly communication.","refs":[]},{"text":"The paper considers the evaluation of digital products and publications in Digital Humanities in Italy a strategic objective to invest for innovation and competitiveness of research: there is the evidence of the need of extending the research community involved in the reviewing process to eliminate the present obstacle of \"subjectivity\"of the evaluation process. The \"strategic value\" for the country lies mainly in the need to find solutions to the complete lack or weakness of the evaluation for digital products and publications that are produced more and more numerous in the humanities, and renewing efforts to stimulate interdisciplinarity and avoiding the lack of visibility and recognition of excellence in research carried out in Italy for the Digital Humanities.","refs":[]},{"text":"We must also say that investments in information technology and communication that all Italian universities have undertaken to provide an adequate infrastructure for research, do not seem to have affected the evaluation of quality of research products, stressing the need for project such as this, to explore new ways to find solutions to this interdisciplinary exploitation.","refs":[]}]}],"tables":{},"abstract":{"title":"Abstract","paragraphs":[{"text":"This research, now in its first phase of development, focuses upon evaluation of Digital Humanities, here indicated as the disciplines, included within the Italian Disciplinary Areas 10 and 11, innovating their research outputs through the application of technological methods. These research outputs are relevant both quantitatively and qualitatively, but do not seem to be considered of value by the current procedures of quality evaluation. The research methodology is including a comparison of the evaluation policies and quality assurance procedures in Europe regarding the different typologies of digital publications. The final product will be a KOS (Knowledge Organization System) based on the Web standards, such as RDF and Linked Open data, to represent and organize the digital products and publications as well as the related agents (persons, institutions, etc.). The KOS will include the results derived by user studies including: 1) a toolkit that will provide rich and meaningful information about the research activity and publications in Digital Humanities. The toolkit will consist of decision tools, able to analyze the content of the proposed knowledge organization system; 2) a platform for the diffusion of Project results, including digital publications, OER for training and other communication tools.","refs":[]}]}}
