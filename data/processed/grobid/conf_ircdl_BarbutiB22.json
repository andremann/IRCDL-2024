Subsequently, the mobile app will prepare itself in \"camera preview\" to allow the user to frame and photograph any page of the analogue book in his possession (obviously one enabled to use the mobile app). Upon successful acquisition, the image will be sent to the appropriate REST service, displayed by the server. Next, the relative alphanumeric \"template\" will be extracted from the picture, which, given as input to the indexer, will allow you to determine which page (and which book) it is, to retrieve the \"target\" URL address to be returned to the mobile app (as the output of the called REST service).","refs":[]},{"text":"The mobile app will view the digital/interactive resource, from the platform, directly in the app itself after the user has received the \"target\" URL address.","refs":[]},{"text":"The user always could repeat the action on other pages of the book or other books (by entering, in this case, a new \"unique identifier\" code).","refs":[]},{"text":"Also, in this case, users actively participate in the perception of the cultural asset, being free to enjoy the contents of their interest.

For this reason, those involved in producing cultural content could entice the user with user-centric experiences to have positive feedback. Furthermore, the user could actively participate in the cultural production, as this is the last \"evaluator\", as demonstrated before with the case studies reported. Hence, cultural institutions seem to understand how people are precious to the life-cycle of experience, primarily digital or phygital. Therefore, as previously reported, choosing content that is little known and perhaps not customarily considered can become a challenge for the supplying institutions and who is called to expand elements digitally. Peculiar goods could be more attractive than others typically considered the praxis, becoming generators of unique and cutting-edge experiences.","refs":[]}]}],"tables":{},"abstract":{"title":"Abstract","paragraphs":[{"text":"The paper presents the research results aimed to design and realize an innovative prototype of user's interactions method, based on the digital impact that Digital Transformation (DT) has on society. The experimentation presented takes as an example some good practices identified in the Victoria & Albert Museum (V&A), London: challenging, unconventional cultural goods could attract new users. Based on this assumption, we have observed a target users' impact on a cultural good generally considered little appeal, transforming the user into a prosumer. The first tests were made in 2019. The University of Bari Aldo Moro and the De Sanctis Classical Linguistic High School of Human Sciences in Trani started a collaboration as part of a PON project titled \"Comunicare e promuovere un evento culturale\". High School students have been identified as an important target of study. Subsequently, in the paper, we examined a project created by D.A.BI.MUS S.r.l. and Quorum Italia S.r.l, working on niche cultural goods also in this case. In this project, an anastatic printed book became a potential endless book capable of intercepting the interest of even large groups of digital users.","refs":[]}]}}
