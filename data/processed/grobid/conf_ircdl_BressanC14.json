To clarify this point, it is enough to think that audio documents have gained the status of documentary sources only recently, and that it is not uncommon to consider texts and icons as first class sources and sound recordings as second class sources. With the multiplication of digitised and born digital sources/documents, the definition of specific criteria for digital philology has become an urgent matter, both for texts and sound.","refs":[]},{"text":"The philological activity of text comparison goes back to Antiquity: one of the means to compare texts was to present them in parallel columns, as shown in Figure 1(a).

What can be the digital equivalent of text comparison for audio? Are we sure what we mean by the term 'text' in audio? Figure 1(b) shows a possible way to compare an audio feature in three different versions of the same recording: are researchers in the area of the humanities trained to read this kind of data presentation? And if we agree that the definition of 'text' should not be limited to the audio signal (such is the authors opinion), how should the complex multimedia digital object (the preservation copy or archive master for preservation) be assembled so that it can make sense to compare it with another created and stored in a different archive?","refs":[{"start":163,"end":164,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_0"},{"start":516,"end":517,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_0"}]},{"text":"Sound recordings have proved to be irreplaceable primary sources for disciplines such as linguistics, musicology, ethnomusicology, sociology and many more.

The economic funding is provided by the Paul Sacher Foundation of Basel (Switzerland), and the entire digitisation process is carried out at the Centro di Sonologia Computazionale (CSC) of the Department of Information Engineering, University of Padua. The importance of the project lies in: (i) the value that the recordings hold for the research community of musicologists and musicians; (ii) the complexity that such an audio collection raises at a scientific-techonological level due to the obsolescence of the media and of the formats. Moreover, there is an additional complexity given by the very nature of the recordings, which include electronic compositions for magnetic tape, and rehearsals or live takes in acoustic scenarios where the distinction between the desired signal and noise is often ambiguous. The expected output of the project is a digital audio col-lection of preservation copies that meet the requirements of accuracy, reliability and authenticity necessary to serve as a valid documentary source for scholarly studies.

In December 1954, Luciano Berio and Bruno Maderna created the first Italian studio of electronic music at the RAI Milan headquarters, inaugurated the following year as the Studio di Fonologia Musicale. There he was able to experiment with the interaction of acoustic instruments and electronically produced sounds. Berio's musical research is characterised by his attainment of an equilibrium between a keen awareness of tradition and a propensity to experiment with new forms of musical communication, and his commitment to music extended to other activities including conducting, the conception of concert series and the promotion of contemporary music. In 1994 he was appointed \"Cavaliere di gran croce dell'Ordine al merito della Repubblica italiana\", and in 1998 he received the \"Medaglia d'oro ai benemeriti della cultura e dell'arte\".

The audio signal is sampled at 96 kHz with a resolution of 24 bits. The file format for audio is uncompressed Wave with PCM encoding. A video recording of the re-mediation is also included in the preservation copy: the video is a close-up of the tape sliding on the heads of the recorder, and its purpose is that of documenting eventual physical imperfections that might affect the audio signal and that should by no means be imputed to the remediation equipment. The selected metadata set is extracted using original software developed at the CSC 4 , integrating JHove 8 (a modular tool for analysis and validation of digital objects) and SoX command line utility 9 . All the data documenting the process of re-mediation are stored in a MySQL database designed on purpose at the CSC. The computer-based system that supports the preservation activities include real-time reporting and data sharing for the stakeholders via web applications with restricted access and secured communication.
