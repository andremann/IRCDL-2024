Historians and scholars had to physically visit archive repositories each time they wanted to consult primary sources, try to get relevant information and then manually assemble cross-references. Today, the huge amount of available digital collections, usually converted in interchangeable formats, makes it feasible to access resources from any place at any time, by offering users the possibility to have direct access to information regardless of where they are physically located.

While DC is particularly suited for enabling searches of library catalogs of digital collections, metadata such as FRBR, EAD and MODS seem to be more devoted to human consumption rather than machine processing [3]. Concerning MARC, some experts experienced that it is not suitable neither for machine processable nor for actionable metadata [4,5].

For instance, vocabularies may have no formal semantics, no defined interrelationships between different terms, and consequently no automatic reasoning technique can be exploited. On the contrary, ontologies are usually specified using the Web Ontology Language OWL [6] language, which has its logical grounding in Description Logics (DLs) [7].

Ontologies can be defined by ontology languages such as the Resource Description Framework Schema (RDFS) [11] and the Web Ontology Language OWL [6]. While RDF is suitable for modeling simple ontologies, OWL is considered a more expressive representation language. The latest version of OWL is OWL 2, which addresses the complexity issue by defining profiles [12], namely fragments for which at least some reasoning tasks are tractable. OWL 2 DL, the version of the Web Ontology Language we focus on, is defined based on Description Logics (DL), which is a family of formal knowledge representation languages that models concepts, roles, individuals and their relationships. In DL, a database is called a knowledge base. In particular, if K = T , A is a knowledge base, then the Tbox T is a set of inclusion assertions, i.e., concept descriptions in AL or some of its extensions, whereas the Abox is a set of membership assertions of the form A(x) and R(x, y) where A is some atomic concept, R is some atomic role and x, y are objects of a domain.

As shown in the example below, Turtle syntax separates the data into two parts: a list of URIs and their abbreviated prefixes, and a list of the triples.

Intuitively speaking, these identifiers represent possible concrete values that are to be obtained in the process of answering the query. Finally, the keyword OPTIONAL refers to the subsequent group pattern. Optional patterns are not required to occur in all retrieved results, but if they are found, may produce bindings of variables -in our case ?date -and thus extend the query result [2].

To give some idea of the range of archival material, the collections occupy about 240 linear meters, namely 2 million pages of documents covering mostly the Polish, European and American history of late 19 th and 20 th century. The majority of archival documents are written in Polish, but the amount of documents in other languages (e.g., Italian, English, Russian, French, Portuguese, and others) is not trivial. The international character of the archival resources draws the attention of a large number of experts and visitors coming from different countries. The collections include not only archival documents but also photographs, films, posters, periodicals, books, personal memoirs of diplomats as well as collection of paintings by Polish and European masters. In the last years, the archival collections have been annotated, digitized, fulltext indexed, and gradually put online on the website of the Institute. The annotation process has been carried out in two steps. In the first step, archive workers have manually annotated each document with relevant entities (e.g., title, author, date of creation, etc.). In the second step, the annotations has been regularly validated and stored in a database. Considering the maturity reached in the development of Semantic Web technologies and Linked Data applications, the Pi lsudski Institute of America started to link the archival data to external resources.","refs":[]}]},{"title":"Modeling Archival Collections with ARKIVO Ontology","paragraphs":[{"text":"arkivo [21] is an ontology designed to accommodate the archival description, supporting archive workers by encompassing both the hierarchical structure of archives and the rich metadata attributes used during the annotation process.

Given the specificity of the archival field, domain experts and archivists often used real scenarios to validate the design of arkivo ontology throughout its development process. In the light of reusability principle [22], we selected some existing standard metadata, such as, e.g., Dublin Core and schema.org10 for describing and cataloguing both physical resources, BIBO ontology11 in order to have a detailed and exhaustive document classification, FOAF 12 for describing agents, Geonames 13 for linking a place name to its geographical location and LODE14 for representing events. Throughout this paper, prefixes, such as dc for Dublin Core, foaf for FOAF, schema for schema.org, and bibo for BIBO ontology, are used to abbreviate URIs.

In fact, manual ontology population is a time consuming task and it requires professional expertise for detecting extractable data. As future work, we will investigate methodologies for the automatizing of the ontology population process exploiting the techniques presented in [25,26]. The second issue deals with query answering over large ontology-enriched datasets. Query answering is not a simple retrieval procedure of explicit facts but involves some inference mechanism capable of discovering new information. In this context, our aim will be to provide fast and efficient query answering over large knowledge bases and thus allow user to build complex queries. The third issue concerns the ability to access, retrieve and use data by non-expert users, namely those who lack technical or domain knowledge skills. In this respect, we are planning to provide some visual tools for querying semantic data that would support users to easily explore all the interesting relationships that arise from encountering a single document in the archive.","refs":[{"start":574,"end":578,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b24"},{"start":578,"end":581,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b25"}]}]}],"tables":{"tab_0":{"heading":"Table 1 .","description":"OWL 2 constructors and the corresponding DL syntax.","rows":[["Constructor","DL syntax"],["Class","C",""],["SubClassOf (C D)","C","D"],["EquivalentClasses (C1...Cn)","C1 ≡ ... ≡ Cn"],["DisjointClasses (C1...Cn)","Ci Cj","⊥"],["","i = j i, j ∈ {1,...,n}"],["DisjointUnion (C C1...Cn)","C = C1 ...
