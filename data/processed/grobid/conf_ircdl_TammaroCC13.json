It has unique advantages such as very low marginal costs for creation, storage, management and speed access and distribution but also involves the disadvantage of increased legal obstacles for access to information and the weakness of economic sustainability. Research in \"Digital Libraries\" has been going on now for over 15 years (even though there is not yet a general agreement on the exact meaning of the term), leading the way to research also in fields of memory institutions. As a result the Digital Library Universe is a very complex one, encompassing a number of different technologies, disciplines and application fields. In addition to that, research in Digital Libraries can be tackled from many different perspectives and angles. Digital Libraries are, for example, information systems and their technology can be researched as such; but they are also organizations and they can be researched also in that respect; they are arenas for the study of information seeking behaviour and for social processes such as learning and knowledge sharing, which can be another dimension of research; they are collections of content that need curation (collection, description, preservation, retrieval, etc); they are social institutions with a social mandate, and as such they are affected by social, demographic and legal issues. Interdisciplinary perspectives cover a wide range of digital libraries management issues and research findings offer insight into educational curriculum and real world practice.","refs":[]},{"text":"From this multifaceted perspective it appears that Digital Libraries continue to be a new topic in existing research fields, and education has to take into account this interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary aspect.

Coleman [7] noted that for too long, LIS schools have responded to the impact of IT in the workplace by simply adding to the existing LIS curricula courses such as Systems Analysis and Design, Database Fundamentals, Human Computer Interaction, and so on. The Computing Curricula [8,10] outline Digital Libraries as an elective area with topics such as digitization, storage and interchange, digital objects, composites and packages, metadata, cataloguing, author submission, etc. Another approach has been to merge; often the merger is with larger departments such as Communications and Education and less often with IT-intensive ones such as Computer Science [12]. Coleman [7] concludes that anecdotal evidence suggests that both approaches leave novice LIS graduates with overwhelming feelings of information overload, the impression that the library profession is in chaos, and a sense that there is no real core LIS disciplinary knowledge beyond the service ethic, descriptive and procedural knowledge of information resources and their use.","refs":[{"start":144,"end":147,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b5"},{"start":415,"end":418,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b6"},{"start":418,"end":421,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b7"},{"start":796,"end":800,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b8"},{"start":810,"end":813,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b5"}]},{"text":"Tennant, a professional librarian, discusses [21] the shortage of digital librarians and explains why public service LIS professionals must become \"tech-savvy\".

At the very least, such approaches could use research findings about interdisciplinary learning to improve the problem solving and competencies of graduates. The Workshop \"Information Technologies profiles and curricula for libraries\", held in Parma in 2005, wanted to identify and define the IT profiles and skills needed in libraries and information centres, and to propose a set of educational actions that could result in making those skills available in the short medium term. A first set of presentations was on the theme \"Relationships and cooperation between IT education and LIS schools\", which provided an overview of the current position in educational issues with respect to information technologies for libraries and recent trends in research on digital libraries. A second set of presentations was introducing and discussing the general theme of \"Competencies and Profiles\", devoted to the contributors' own experience and case studies of skills and competencies.

The first profile was that of a \"digital librarian\", with a deep knowledge of the (digital) content of the library, and enough knowledge of IT tools to allow him/her to\" curate\" (the term was not yet trendy at that time) the collections of the library. The second profile was that of a \"system librarian\", with a good knowledge of Information Technologies and Architecture, and enough knowledge of library services and management to allow him/her to formulate the requirements for a Digital Library Management System and to use and manage the system once that it was operational.","refs":[]},{"text":"In the second event, a panel at ECDL 2008, it was discussed the relationships between the Web and both the traditional and the digital libraries. To stimulate discussion, the view of one camp was claimed to be that since \"all\" the information was available on-line, the use of smart search engines and clever software tools would allow the Web to provide all the information (and the services) needed by an information seeker. The view of the other camp was that the value of information was not just in its sheer quantity, but was rather in the organization and the quality of the information made available, and that could never be accomplished by \"programs\". Some years later, with the continuous increase of the information available on the Web and the advances in search engine technologies, an even more radical question could be raised, questioning the need of libraries at all, whether digital or not. More and more it appears that when there is an information need, everybody (including scholars) is first \"googling\" on the Web to find the desired information, and it is not known how many information seekers will continue by accessing also some (digital) libraries in order to satisfy their information need. During these years however, digital library technologies have supported the transition of libraries from traditional to digital, and those technologies are today mature enough to support not only the availability of the library content online, but also the provision of advanced services for library users.","refs":[]},{"text":"At the end of the panel the position that gathered most of the consensus was the one supported (not surprisingly) by Google, The main mission of a web search engine should be to provide access to the \"world's information\", and make it universally accessible and useful, whereas the main mission of a digital library should be to organize the information needed and used by one or more specific user communities and make it easily accessible and useful to those communities. The difference in mission implies therefore a difference in scale (the web is measured in billions of pages, a digital library is measured, at best, in millions of documents), a difference in coverage (as broad as possible in the web, as deep as possible in the library) and a difference in services, i.e. how to add value to the content of the library (precision and general services in the web, completeness and specific services for a user community in the library). The web and the digital library have therefore similar and complementing missions, and they should take advantage of each other, and focus on the delivery of useful and relevant (web) services to their user communities.","refs":[]},{"text":"What emerged from these first two events was the identification of three main profiles at the operational level of a library. Two of them, namely the digital librarian and the system librarian, have been mentioned before , while the third one, that could be called the \"end-user librarian\", is a profile with a deep knowledge of the information needs and applications of the selected user community. The end-user librarian should be able to provide input to the digital librarian on one side and to assist the library users on the other, by providing reference services (possibly using web search engines) and assistance in the use of the new functionality (possibly) made available by the digital library, such as annotations and collaboratories.","refs":[]}]},{"title":"Research in Digital Library","paragraphs":[{"text":"In 2010 the International Master DILL (DIgital Libraries Learning) and the European project DL.org organized together a one-day seminar (\"Research & Education in Digital Libraries\"), as a forum for discussion between the research communities participating in the DL.org activities and the communities of Digital Library education in Europe, with the aim of starting a dialogue about research and education in digital library and to explore ways for a closer cooperation between those communities. DILL is a two-year international master program (which was funded until 2011 by the European Union under the Erasmus Mundus program) that is bringing forward the idea of interdisciplinary education in Digital Libraries by providing to its students courses which span some of the different aspects underlying digital libraries. DL.org (now ended) was a project funded by the European Union under the 7th Framework Program to bring forward a research program focussed on interoperability in digital libraries, which means that research should consider not only the technical dimension, but also other dimensions that might be affected by interoperability issues (e.g. policy, quality, user profiles, legal aspects). Among the main accomplishments of the DL.org project there is the completion of a conceptual model for Digital Libraries [3] (initiated by the DELOS Network of Excellence), which includes the three roles (profiles) of library professionals mentioned above, and which has been widely used in DILL and in other courses and Summer Schools addressing the educational needs of library professionals, to establish a common view of the entities and the concepts underlying the \"Digital Library Universe\".","refs":[{"start":1332,"end":1335,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b2"}]},{"text":"The stated objectives of the seminar (only partially attained) were:","refs":[]},{"text":"• Start discussing how to implement a European scale mechanism for exchanging, sharing and integrating research results into education in digital libraries • Start defining research topics suitable for PhD students to ease the integration of research done in European projects and research done in Universities • Discuss how the interoperability research results of DL.org can be transferred to education in digital libraries","refs":[]},{"text":"The discussions prompted by a number of interesting presentations brought into evidence a wide range of issues, going from the need to transfer research outcomes into learning material, to the need for DL professionals to have hands-on experience with IT tools and services, to the need to work towards stronger theoretical foundations for digital libraries.

The aim of the workshop was to bring forward the discussions already started at the previous events, namely how to better exploit the results of research for education in Digital Libraries, or more generally, for education to \"information workers\". As briefly mentioned at the beginning, all professionals working in the socalled \"memory institutions\" (libraries, archives and museums) are increasingly facing the need to reconsider their educational needs in order to maintain the traditional leadership in the cycle of knowledge creation, distribution and preservation. The increased availability of digital information made possible by the Web is blurring the boundaries between those institutions and is transforming the respective professionals in a more general role of \"information workers\". The main thread of discussion was a critical review of the roles of the information professionals, considering not only the impact brought by the advances in the technical dimension, but considering also other dimensions such as policy, quality, user profiles, legal aspects, etc.","refs":[]},{"text":"A number of interesting topics were presented and discussed during the workshop, such as the need for a theoretical foundation in order to transform the \"librarian profession\" into a \"librarianship discipline\"; the possibility of using a \"conformance checklist\" to assess the conformance of a digital library with the conceptual model proposed by DL.org, showing how the checklist could provide the basis for defining a set of topics needed in digital library education. A discussion about the skills needed by a professional in order to evaluate a digital library, focusing more on the organizational and interpersonal skills rather than the technical ones, was useful in highlighting a (different) set of topics needed in digital library education. Several examples advocated the early involvement of students into research projects requiring skills both in Library and Information Science and in Computer Science. An interesting perspective introduced the notion that a change in terminology, when going from the library world to the world of the Web and Linked Open Data (e.g. from \"catalogue\" to \"graph\", from \"document\" to \"aggregation\"), actually implies a complete re-thinking of the meaning of all those terms, and therefore also a re-thinking of their educational aspects.","refs":[]},{"text":"A concluding panel provided additional views and experiences in education in digital libraries.

Over the last 15 years Digital Libraries, or more generally the \"Memory Institutions\", have seen a significant level of research in many of the fields that in one way or another are related to the production, description, collection, preservation, retrieval and usage of digital information. In many cases the outcome of those research activities has resulted in tools and technologies (e.g. interoperability of data at the semantic level, natural language processing, automatic analysis and classification of texts, building of multimedia collections) which allow a more effective way of providing the traditional services of the memory institutions.","refs":[]},{"text":"In parallel with those developments, the educational curricula of librarians, archivists and museum curators have been (slowly) updated to reflect the changes in the professional environment, but those changes in the curricula often appear to be dictated more by the need to \"run after\" the technology, rather than a deep re-thinking of the educational needs of the memory professionals, resulting just in the increase of the \"technology component\" of the curricula.","refs":[]},{"text":"The presentations and the discussions during the panel somehow confirmed those initial considerations, especially when looking at some of the emerging areas of interest for the publication, access and re-use of scientific material.

Further research is needed to evaluate this and other strategies based on the recognition of a wider range of channels for communication of research to practice and education. The events showed a tendency to converge into a few subfields, such as digital curation, information seeking and Digital Library use, information retrieval in the Web. However, the declining share of theoretical developments are showing to Library and Information Science researchers the urgency and the importance of continuous and creative research in that field, in collaboration with Computer Science researchers.","refs":[]}]}],"tables":{},"abstract":{"title":"Abstract","paragraphs":[{"text":"Two major themes continue to be a subject of discussion when dealing with digital libraries: how should the education programs in LIS (Library and Information Science) schools be changed or updated in order to provide the needed knowledge (skills ?) for librarians in the digital age and, closely related, how could the three major memory institutions (libraries, archives and museums) define common educational curricula for professionals in the three domains, now that the digital age is blurring the boundaries between the three profession. In this paper we will present some considerations about the first topic, in order to share the experience gained through the organization and the participation in five events, having as theme the educational needs of the new librarians and the possible synergies of research and education in the field of digital libraries. It is hoped that it can serve as a further stimulus for discussions and for the definition of possible common actions in the digital libraries community.","refs":[]}]}}
