In fact, as soon as the OpenAIRE deduplication merges different ORCID referrals from the same research output, the various ORCID iDs used collide, and the author presents them all in the paper \"reconciled\" metadata.

We intend to quantitatively extend the present study, so to provide a detailed outlook on the current incidence and impact of the aforementioned classes of misuse in ORCID. In this section, we elaborate on possible actions which could be undertaken in order to address such issues, making a distinction between ORCID registry misuses and ORCID clients misuses.","refs":[]}]},{"title":"Mitigation of ORCID registry misuses","paragraphs":[{"text":"Four classes of misuses have been identified: fake ORCID profiles, poor-quality profiles, overly-identified users, and profile up-to-dateness.","refs":[]},{"text":"In order to solve, or at least mitigate, the anomalies mentioned above, a combined set of actions could be taken, which mainly suggest the ORCID registry to be more \"restrictive\" and \"rigorous\" when approaching its users, i.e. researchers and organisations.","refs":[]},{"text":"First of all, individual institutions and research organisations could, for example, take over control of the registration process to ORCID, as well as the dissemination of ORCID \"philosophy\" and best practices. The recent inclusion of institutional Identity Providers (IDPs) in ORCID login is undoubtedly a step forward in this direction; however, it does not suffice alone. Indeed, users still can register to ORCID providing a minimal amount of information, i.e., just a name and a valid, potentially non-institutional, email, or even register via Google and Facebook single sign-on. ORCID registrants could forget how they created their account in the first place and register afresh using one of the several other methods provided, quickly ending up in duplicates and fragmentation of information. Surely, enforcing the access to ORCID only via institutional IDPs would pose issues upon researchers relocation to another institution, and the consequent change of IDP, which certainly has to be handled accordingly. Nonetheless, we believe that this would dramatically improve the accuracy of the information contained in ORCID, and put a stop to the proliferation of fake profiles. Furthermore, an extensive analysis of the email domains of the existing user base would enable ORCID to identify non-institutional ones and notify the authors for an action. At that point, non-compliant ORCID users could be flagged and deprecated (but never fully deleted, as they are PIDs7 ) if no action is taken within a given cool-down period. Indeed, a minority of rather uncommon independent researchers not affiliated to research institutions does exist. Such cases need to be handled with special care. One possible solution to this problem could consist in contacting coauthors or colleagues present on ORCID for an \"endorsement\".","refs":[{"start":1476,"end":1477,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_5"}]},{"text":"To improve the quality and completeness of profiles, ORCID could ask registered users to simply provide more information, such as family name, alternate name forms and affiliations.

Potential causes are: non-existent ORCID iDs, and wrongly-attributed iDs. In order to mitigate these issues, ORCID clients should be equipped with tools that allow users, during metadata ingestion, to automatically recover ORCID iDs directly from the ORCID registry, systematically avoiding manual insertion. Such capabilities would exclude the non-existent ORCID iDs issue and certainly mitigate the wrongly-attributed issue as a whole (cases of homonymy still could be troubling) while completely avoiding the shuffle subset.","refs":[]}]}],"tables":{},"abstract":{"title":"Abstract","paragraphs":[{"text":"Since 2012, the \"Open Researcher and Contributor Identification Initiative\" (ORCID) has been successfully running a worldwide registry, with the aim of unequivocally pinpoint researchers and the body of knowledge they contributed to. In practice, ORCID clients, e.g., publishers, repositories, and CRIS systems, make sure their metadata can refer to iDs in the ORCID registry to associate authors and their work unambiguously. However, the ORCID infrastructure still suffers from several \"service misuses\", which put at risk its very mission and should be therefore identified and tackled. In this paper, we classify and qualitatively document such misuses, occurring from both users (researchers and organisations) of the ORCID registry and the ORCID clients.
