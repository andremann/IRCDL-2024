The large number of these multimedia objects and their inherent complexity has led to the need of specific services for their management and interrogation. Digital Libraries organized digital collections of multimedia objects available online in computer processable form [4]. These libraries also comprise services and infrastructures to manage, store, retrieve and share objects. In [12] the authors identify many core topics focusing on Digital Libraries research area.

The goal of this paper is to show how the use of uncertain graphs, an increasingly important research topic [14,22,9], is useful to manage and solve some information filtering problems. In particular, we will see how relationships among users and among multimedia objects with their corresponding likelihood could be easily encoded adopting an uncertain graph. This probabilistic knowledge can then be used to infer the probability of existence of links between an user and an object involved in the graph. Predicting possible relationships between an user and a multimedia object can help to find useful information and to suggest multimedia objects that user could be interested in. The proposed probabilistic framework will be evaluated along its ability to represent multimedia objects, users and their relationships and to predict new relationships among the involved entities. The basic definition of uncertain graph will be extended to that of multigraphs in order to deal with multiple connection types between nodes. In particular, we will study the behavior of the system by varying the considered neighborhood of the nodes, by studying the inference accuracy, and by considering contextual information.

Personalization services for Digital Library are a key component for the fruition of the contents. Their implementation is very close to the problem of recommender systems [1] and link prediction [7], since they share the same objective to filter relevant contents for the user. A recommender system performs information filtering to bring information items such as movies, music, books, news, images, web pages, tools to a user. This information is filtered so that it is likely to interest the user. It is possible to categorize a recommender system into five groups depending on the required knowledge as follows.","refs":[{"start":546,"end":549,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b0"},{"start":570,"end":573,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b6"}]},{"text":"Content-Based Systems.

Collaborative Filtering Systems. Collaborative filtering systems are based on collecting and analysing a large amount of information about users behaviour and preferences, and predicting what users will like based on their similarity to other users. These systems ignore the representation of multimedia objects.

A similar problem is the link prediction problem that wants to infer missing links from an observed network: in a number of domains, one constructs a network of interactions based on observable data and then tries to infer additional links that, while not directly visible, are likely to exist [8,13,17]. Demographic Systems. These systems create a user profile based on demographic information. The suggested new multimedia objects is retrieved by considering the user demographic information and ignoring information about the description of the objects. Knowledge-Based Systems. These systems use a user profile that the user has previously filled. In this profile the user explicitly indicates his preferences in order to guide the suggestions of the system. Hybrid Systems. These hybrid recommendation systems combine the results of multiple recommendation systems in order to obtain a more accurate recommendation. They could be divided into homogeneous recommendation systems which combine the output from different versions of the same recommender system and heterogeneous recommendation systems which combines the output from different recommender systems.","refs":[{"start":669,"end":672,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b7"},{"start":672,"end":675,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b12"},{"start":675,"end":678,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b16"}]},{"text":"Over the last few years uncertain graphs have become an important research topic [14,20,21].

The network reliability problem [5] is a generalization of the pairwise reachability, in which the goal is to determine the probability that all pairs of nodes are reachable from one another. Unlike a deterministic graph in which the reachability function is a binary function indicating whether or not there is a path connecting two nodes, in the case of uncertain graphs the function assumes probabilistic values. In [14], the authors provide a list of alternative shortest path distance measures for uncertain graphs in order to discover the k closest vertices to a given one. Another work [11] try to deal with the concept of xy distance constraint reachability problem. In particular, given two vertices x and y, they try to solve the problem of computing the probability that the distance from x to y is less than or equal to a user-defined threshold. In order to solve this problem, they proposed an exact algorithm and two reachability estimators based on probability sampling. In this paper the idea is to use the expressive power of uncertain graphs formalism to address the information filtering problem and to allow the user to find objects of interest. The approach proposed in this paper takes advantage of the encouraging results obtained in [16], where the uncertain graph formalism has been applied to solve the problem of collaborative filtering. In this paper we extended that framework to uncertain multigraph, allowing us to represent many heterogeneous connections among the involved entities. In order to test the multigraph extension we applied the system on an extension of the Movielens dataset used in [16] and its performances have been tested adopting different metrics. Furthermore, the behavior of the system has been studied by varying the neighborhood of the nodes during the creation of the uncertain graph, and by varying the inference accuracy. Finally, we will introduce contextual information in the form of probabilistic edges to study whether it contributes to the improvement in the inference step.","refs":[{"start":126,"end":129,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b4"},{"start":513,"end":517,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b13"},{"start":687,"end":691,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b10"},{"start":1351,"end":1355,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b15"},{"start":1723,"end":1727,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b15"}]}]},{"title":"Uncertain Multi-graphs","paragraphs":[{"text":"Let G = (V, E), be a graph where V is a collection of nodes and E ∈ V × V is the set of edges, or relationships, between the nodes. where (V,E) is an directed graph, V is the set of nodes, E is the set of ordered pairs of nodes where e=(s,t), Σ is a set of labels, l V : V → Σ is a function assigning labels to nodes, l E : E → Σ is a function assigning labels to the edges, s : E → V is a function indicating the source node of an edge, t : E → V is a function indicating the target node of an edge, and p e : E → [0, 1] is a function assigning existence probability values to the edges.","refs":[{"start":132,"end":141,"marker":"figure","target":null},{"start":141,"end":142,"marker":"figure","target":null}]}]},{"title":"Definition 1 (Uncertain multi-graph).

This dataset is an extension of the Movielens dataset and contains user ratings expressing preferences for different movies. The dataset contains 2113 users, 10197 films and 855598 ratings. The ratings are one of 10 distinct values ranging from 0.5 to 5.0 with increments of 0.5. The meta-data available include user-movie tag information, movie genres, movie directors, country assignments, and aggregate statistics of audience and critics ratings. The dataset has been divided in training and testing data. The testing part includes the last four ratings for each user, while the training part includes all the previous ones. Then, the validation procedure has been conducted following the steps: a) creating the uncertain graph from the training data as reported in Section 4; b) defining a regular expression corresponding to a specific information filtering task; and c) testing the ratings reported in the testing dataset T by computing, for each pair (u, i) ∈ T the predicted rating as in Equation ( 12) and comparing the prediction with the true rating as reported in T . In this particular dataset we have a uncertain graph with nodes labeled as user or film. There are edges between two film nodes labeled as simF or simFA, and edges with label simU or simUG between two user nodes. These edges are added using the procedure presented in the previous section. In particular, simF denotes the probability that two films could be similar and it has been computed using (9), while simU indicates the probability that two users are similar computed with (8). simFA edges connecting two films whose probability has been computed using (10), in particular simFA has been computed using the actors of the films. simUG connects two users with a probability corresponding to the similarity computed using the histogram of the rated films' genres. For each rating (u, i, r ui = k) belonging to the training set there is an edge between the user u and the film i whose label is r k . The goal is to predict the correct rating for each instance belonging to the testing set T . The predicted rating has been computed using a Monte Carlo approach by sampling certain graphs and adopting the function in (12).","refs":[{"start":57,"end":58,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_1"},{"start":1089,"end":1091,"marker":"formula","target":"#formula_22"},{"start":1559,"end":1562,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b8"},{"start":1642,"end":1645,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b7"},{"start":1722,"end":1726,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b9"},{"start":2282,"end":2286,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b11"}]},{"text":"The accuracy of the proposed framework has been evaluated according to the mean absolute error (MAE) and to the root mean squared error (RMSE), that are the two most commonly applied evaluation metrics for rating predictions.

The first language constrained simple paths L 1 corresponds to solve a user-based information filtering problem, while the third language L 3 gives us the possibility to simulate an item-based information filtering approach. As we can see from Table 2 results improve when we go from a user-based approach to a item-based in terms of MAE. We can see also that adopting languages L 2 and L 4 , that consider contextual edges amongs users or items, we have improving results. In the second experiment, we proposed to extend the basic languages L 3 and L 4 in order to consider a neighbourhood with many nested levels. In particular, instead of considering the direct neighbours only, we inspect the uncertain graph following a path with a maximum length of two edges (L 5 ,L 6 ) and three edges (L 7 ). As we can see in Table 3 languages L 5 ,L 6 and L 7 , where we extend the neighborhood of the explored graph, when compared with languages L 3 and L 4 achieved better results. Furthermore, languages L 8 , L 9 and L 10 corresponds to a hybrid system combining both user-based and item-based approach, whose corresponding results are shown in Table 4. In each table, reporting the MAE results, the first column reports the neighbourhood of the most similar nodes introduced in the graph for each similarity function, and the second column reports the number of sampling adopting for each languages.  Table 5 shows the results on HetRec2011 dataset, using a 10-fold crossvalidation, comparing the proposed framework with respect to neighborhoodbased recommendation methods reported in [2]. The approach proposed in [2] exploit also the tags assigned by the users in order to extract latent semantics by using Latent Semantic Analysis. The first recommender was based on collaborative filtering using the cosine similarity to build user neighbourhoods, the second uses content analysis on latent topic analysis, while the third was based on a simple average rating. As we can see in Table 5, even without using tag information, the obtained results adopting our system are better than, or comparable to, those obtained with the approaches exploited in [2].

Users, items and their relationships are encoded in a probabilistic graph that can be used to infer the probability of existence of a link between entities involved in the graph.
