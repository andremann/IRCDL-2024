It is a challenging task and it is revolutionizing many real-world applications. For example, starting from a Digital Library of adventure books it could be possible to enrich the reading experience with computer-generated images of the locations explored in the story, while a Digital Library of recipe books may be enriched with images representing the steps involved in a given recipe. In addition, such images may be used to exploit Information Retrieval systems based on visual similarity. Due to its great potentiality and usefulness, it raised a lot of interest in the research fields of Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Digital Libraries.","refs":[]},{"text":"One of the main approaches used for the text-to-image task involves the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) [6]: starting from a given textual description, GANs can be conditioned on text [24,25,35] in order generate highquality images that are highly related to the text meaning.","refs":[{"start":117,"end":120,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b5"},{"start":197,"end":201,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b23"},{"start":201,"end":204,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b24"},{"start":204,"end":207,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b33"}]},{"text":"To condition a GAN on text, captioned images datasets are needed, meaning that one (or more) captions must be associated to each image. Despite the large amount of uncaptioned images datasets, the number of captioned datasets is limited. For example, LSUN [33] dataset, which consists in more than 59 million labeled images for each of 10 scene categories and 20 object categories [33]. The LSUN-bedroom dataset contains images from LSUN dataset tagged with the \"bedroom\" scene category. It contains around ∼3,000,000 images [33], but it does not contain the associated captions. This may lead to a difficulty in training a conditional GAN to generate bedroom images related to a given textual description, such as \"a bedroom with blue walls, white furniture and a large bed\". In this paper we propose an innovative, though quite simple approach to address this issue as shown in Fig. 1. First of all, a captioning system (that we call Image Captioning Module) is trained on a generic captioned dataset and used to generate a caption for the uncaptioned images. Then, the conditional GAN (that we call GAN Module) is trained on both the input image and the \"machine-generated\" caption. A highlevel representation of the architecture is shown in Fig. 2. To evaluate the results, the performance of the GAN using \"machine-generated\" captions are compared with the results obtained by the unconditional GAN. To test and evaluate our pipeline, we are using the LSUN-bedroom [33] dataset. The results obtained in the experiments are very preliminary yet very promising. According to our study, the GAN Module does not learn how to produce meaningful images, with respect to the caption meaning, and we hypothesize that this is due to the \"machine-generated\" captions we use to condition the GAN Module. The Image Captioning module is trained on the COCO dataset [17], which contains captioned images for many different classes of objects and intuitively this should lead the Image Captioning Module to learn how to produce captions for bedroom images as well. Despite being able to produce the desired captions, we notice that the \"machine-generated\" captions are often too similar and not detailed for different bedroom images. The last section of the paper proposes some approaches that can deal with these problems.","refs":[{"start":256,"end":260,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b31"},{"start":381,"end":385,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b31"},{"start":525,"end":529,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b31"},{"start":885,"end":886,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_0"},{"start":1250,"end":1251,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_1"},{"start":1470,"end":1474,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b31"},{"start":1857,"end":1861,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b16"}]}]},{"title":"Related Work","paragraphs":[{"text":"In 2014, Goodfellow et al. introduced Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) [6], a generative model framework that consists in training simultaneously two models: a generator network and a discriminator one.

[19] used an approximate Langevin sampling approach to generate images conditioned on text, but it required an inefficient iterative optimization process. In [25], Reed et al. successfully generated 64 × 64 images for birds and flowers conditioning on text descriptions. In their follow-up work [24], they were able to generate 128 × 128 images by using additional annotations on object part locations. Denton et al. in [5] proposed the Laplacian pyramid framework (LAPGANs), which is composed of a series of GANs. A residual image is conditioned at each level of the pyramid on the image of the previous stage to produce an image for the next stage. Also in [13], Kerras et al. use a similar approach by incrementally adding more layers in the generator and in the discriminator. [34] and [35] suggest the use of a so-called sketch-refinement process, where the images are first generated at low resolutions using a GAN conditioned over the textual description, and then refined with another GAN conditioned on both the image generated at the previous step and the input textual description. [9] and [15] infer a semantic label map by predicting bounding boxes and object shapes from the text, and then synthesize an image conditioned on the layout and the text description. A recent work by Qiao et al. [21] uses a three-step approach where it first computes word-and sentence-level embedding from the given textual description, then it uses the embeddings to generate images in a cascaded architecture, and finally starting from the image generated at the previous step it tries to regenerate the original textual description, in order to semantically align with it.

Moreover, the metrics used during the testing phase are non-differentiable (such as BLEU and CIDEr), meaning that the captioning model can not be trained to directly optimize them. To overcome these problems, Reinforcement Learning techniques such as the REINFORCE algorithm have been used. SCST is a variation and an improvement of the popular REINFORCE algorithm that, rather than estimating a baseline to normalize the rewards and reduce variance, utilizes the output of its own test-time inference algorithm to normalize the rewards it experiences. This means that it is forced to improve the performance of the model under the inference algorithm used at test time.
