In brief, semantic publishing is the use of Web and Semantic Web technologies to represent formally the meaning of a published document, by specifying a large quantity of information about it as metadata and to publish them as Open Linked Data. As a confirmation of this trend, recently the Nature Publishing Group (publisher of Nature), the American Association for the Advancement of Science (publisher of Science) and the Oxford University Press have all announced initiatives to open their articles' reference lists and to publish them as Open Linked Data 1,2 . The open archive movement 3 is increasing in the field scientific papers publishing and big commercial companies, like i.e. Springer, support the idea of \"institutional repositories\" and the concept of \"open access publishing\" as a solution that \"makes your work immediately and permanently available online for everyone, everywhere\" 4 .

Digital libraries of scientific papers use these techniques, theories and methods in order non only to speed up the access given to publications but also to increase the amount of digital data i.e. research articles, they can associate to such articles. Even editors and publishers that did not marry into the open access philosophy are creating digital collections of scientific papers under the guise of freemium platforms for accessing for free the metadata related to their publication, and pay for the full-text of the articles.

However, this enhancement is not a straightforward operation, since it involves much more that simply making semantically precise statements about named entities within the text.
