The first description of Artificial Intelligence ante litteram is that of Turing that in 1950 speaks of imitation game in the famous article [6] in which he describes the experiment that the machine will overcome when an interlocutor at the keyboard will not be able to distinguish between the responses of a machine and a human being. Very close to a classic definition of Artificial Intelligence formulated in the «Dartmouth program» of 1955: «making a machine behave in ways that would be called intelligent if a human were so behaving» 12 . In both cases there is no mention of agency, but intelligence is manifested, presumably, in the ability to act. Taddeo and Floridi in 2018 reformulate the 1955 concept in richer and more nuanced terms, abandoning the idea of imitation: a growing resource of interactive, autonomous, self-learning agency, which enables computational artifacts to perform tasks that otherwise would require human intelligence to be executed successfully [16] and precisely in the topic of agency they propose a more complex reading: the effects of decisions or actions based on AI are often the result of countless interactions among many actors, including designers, developers, users, software, and hardware. This is known as distributed agency. With distributed agency comes distributed responsibility [16] That is, the functioning of an Artificial Intelligence system expresses the implications and consequences of the choices made by those who produced it (distributed agency) -and all these people are co-responsible (distributed responsibility) with the Artificial Intelligence system for the decisions and actions it takes 13 : and this is what appears from the production process of the book of \"Beta Writer\" that has been exposed in in a summary way.","refs":[{"start":650,"end":653,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b5"},{"start":1049,"end":1051,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_7"},{"start":1490,"end":1494,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b13"},{"start":1841,"end":1845,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b13"},{"start":2167,"end":2169,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_8"}]}]},{"title":"Conclusions","paragraphs":[{"text":"The 2019 \"Beta Writer event\" is a watershed between a before and an after.
