The autocorrelation function is defined as the cross correlation of a signal with itself, and represents a measure of similarity between two signals. Once applied to a grayscale image, it produces a central symmetric matrix, that gives an idea of the degree of regularity of the texture.

Many times, they effectively resemble line drawings, thus they were included in our detection. The solution would be to train a specific detector for music scores, for example, but this would provide an unfair advantage with respect to a generic layout analysis system, such as the one we are comparing against.","refs":[]}]},{"title":"Conclusion","paragraphs":[{"text":"In this paper we proposed a method to automatic extract illustrations from digitized historical documents. Starting from the assumption that text regions are characterized by a strong horizontal repeating pattern we introduced a descriptor based on the autocorrelation of squared blocks that demonstrated to be effective even with drawing and charts. We compared our method with Tesseract and we showed it is able to detect challenging illustration also when the state-of-the-art fails.","refs":[]},{"text":"Our proposal represents an useful tool for a future enrichment of historical manuscripts with renovated contents.
