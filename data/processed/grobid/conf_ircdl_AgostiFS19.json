There has always been a strong interrelationship among IR and DL, and one significant example of this is the major organization which promotes IR, the Association for Computing Machinery Special Interest Group on Information Retrieval (ACM SIGIR), 1 which is also one of the co-promoters of one of the major international forums focusing on digital libraries, the Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (JCDL). 2 Moreover, the programs of all conferences on DL also cover IR topics, and many methods and techniques designed and developed by the IR research community are used in the design and building of DL. Another significant example of this synergy is the ideation and development of the first \"online public access catalogues\" (OPACs) [2,6,11], which made broad use of state-of-the-art IR methods in a typical DL setting.

The synergy between DL and IR foreseen in [9] can also be found in the most relevant topics addressed by ACM SIGIR papers, especially with regard to the use of relevance feedback and cross-lingual search. Digital libraries also played a relevant role within the ACM SIGIR community because they provided (and still provide) interesting search tasks and challenging collections to work with. Most of the ACM SIGIR papers categorized with \"Digital Library\" deal with: searching documents in semi-structured formats such as XML, identifying math formulas and retrieving formulas from textual documents, cooperative search done by expert users, finding translations or searching scanned book collections, federated document retrieval and using user feedback to improve search results. All these aspects are clearly related to DL since they provide wide and challenging document collections that need to be accessed and efficiently searched; in past years XML was a central format for document exchange and encoding, now RDF is growing and the use of semantics and relations between entities and documents are gaining traction. DL on the one hand provides the data and user requirements that can be addressed by IR research, while on the other hand it employs the results that the IR community produces.

This resulted in a growth in the interest of researchers in the DL area with positive spill-overs into other fields as shown by a growing number of DL-related papers published at ACM SIGIR in 2006-2007. In recent years, research investments have shifted to other topics, thus reducing the interest in DL topics which translated into a smaller number of researchers dedicated to this field; this is also evident when considering ACM SIGIR publications in the last three years, in fact there were almost no DL-related paper presented at the conference.","refs":[]},{"text":"By conducting this study we realized that DL is a field which still has great potential because it has unique collections of textual and non-textual documents and a wide and heterogeneous user base with all kinds of access and search tasks. Nevertheless, in order to keep up the high level of research activity in this field it is necessary to maintain a highly multidisciplinary profile that can continue to attract researchers from other fields and that can \"feed\" other related research fields with challenging data and tasks to be addressed. This synergy, if constantly sustained and nurtured, has a true potential for improving DL services as well as search and access methods in general.","refs":[]}]},{"title":"Future Directions.","paragraphs":[{"text":"For the presented analysis we relied on a text mining approach; on the other hand, a bibliometrical approach would allow us to better investigate the interrelationships among papers and authors of the IR and DL fields, and how these two fields influence each other. This would also allow us to identify which authors are peculiar to the DL and who instead belong to both the IR and DL communities. Thus, we plan to use a bibliometric approach to undertake further analyses in the future, and we plan to extend the analysis considering in addition the impact of the public and private funding initiatives in the DL community. To this end, we could leverage on DBLP-NSF [12], that connects computer science publications extracted from DBLP to their NSF funding grants, by extending it also to European and National funding agencies.","refs":[{"start":668,"end":672,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b12"}]}]}],"tables":{"tab_0":{"heading":"Table 1 .","description":"Number of papers published in ACM SIGIR proceedings from 2003 to 2017 and number of active authors per year.","rows":[["Year Number of papers Number of active authors"],["2003 106","252"],["2004 133","293"],["2005 138","341"],["2006 152","335"],["2007 221","482"],["2008 206","461"],["2009 207","501"],["2010 217","504"],["2011 238","559"],["2012 224","562"],["2013 210","512"],["2014 229","588"],["2015 204","524"],["2016 234","647"],["2017 255","705"]]},"tab_1":{"heading":"Table 2 .","description":"Top 15 most used words in title and abstract and most used keywords in ACM SIGIR papers in the period 2003-2017.","rows":[["Country","Contribution Percentage"],["USA","37%"],["Republic of China","14%"],["United Kingdom","8%"],["Canada","4%"],["Singapore","4%"],["Spain","3%"],["The Netherlands","3%"],["Hong Kong","3%"],["Australia","3%"],["Italy","2%"],["Israel","2%"],["Japan","1%"],["Brazil","1%"],["Switzerland","1%"],["Japan","1%"],["India","1%"],["South Korea","1%"],["Russia","1%"],["Taiwan","1%"],["Finland","1%"],["France","1%"],["Other","4%"],["Fig. 1.
