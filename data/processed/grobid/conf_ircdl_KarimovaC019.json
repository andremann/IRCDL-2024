However, in conversation with the group it was decided to use the INESC TEC dataset deposit form because the descriptors recommended in the domain repository were considered too specialized and not suitable for their data.

They agree on the challenging nature of the data description process. We noticed that some concepts were easily understood, but others such as metadata or descriptor required more discussion, and the support provided by the RDM team was valued. Another common difficulty was the knowledge of metadata standards to be used in their domains. Dublin Core was used as an example of a generic standard. Although they felt the need to make their data accessible to others, they did not know how to do it. Table 3 compares the number of descriptor occurrences, by descriptor, filled in by the researchers in the first description round, with the final number of occurrences after the collaboration with the curator. The final number corresponds to the metadata actually included in the deposit of the dataset.","refs":[{"start":688,"end":689,"marker":"table","target":"#tab_1"}]},{"text":"The results show that the Title, Author and Author email descriptors were the most frequently used. The Description element is also among the most used ones, which is natural since it is a descriptor that gives flexibility to capture information that otherwise would make sense in domain-specific elements, e.g. concerning experimental configurations. The descriptor Tags was widely used by the researchers to represent the subject, with the goal of improving data findability in the repository. The descriptors Source, Contributor, and Format.Extent were the least used. The Contributor descriptor was used a few times and only for the description of external parties, while group members were identified as Author. In all cases, when the raw data belonged to other institutions or researchers, the descriptor Source was used, sometimes upon recommendation.","refs":[]},{"text":"Moreover, the results show that in general the metadata was improved after the feedback provided by the curator, particularly with a more detailed description by increasing the number of descriptors used. The Date descriptor, which can be captured in every domain, was added fifteen times by the researchers. We looked into this and tried to understand why the date information was missing in some cases. We concluded that the descriptor meaning was too ambiguous for the researchers, who often asked if the date was for the creation of the dataset or for the start of the project. Based on this feedback we added a more precise definition and made sure the Date information was present in all metadata records by the time the datasets were deposited.","refs":[]},{"text":"Although some descriptors have the same number of occurrences, some of them have also been corrected by the curator to improve the quality of the description. The dataset Title was edited in some circumstances, for instance from \"Capsule videos\" to a more accurate \"Red Lesion Endoscopy Dataset\" after the recommendations by the curator. Another question related to controlled vocabularies has to do with the License. By default, in CKAN values for this descriptor come from a list of licenses, as a closed controlled vocabulary. In some cases, it was necessary to add the Dublin Core descriptor License to add specific information, not on the list, e.g. \"Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 2.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0)\".","refs":[]},{"text":"Controlled vocabularies are useful tools and could be used in specific descriptors as custom fields in INESC TEC repository.

Although most researchers are not familiar with metadata concepts, let alone metadata standards, they show different levels of awareness, thus requiring us to adapt our approach to each domain. The data deposit process was adapted to researchers' perspectives and agendas. Each collaboration took from one to more than two months. It was important to adopt flexible strategies to gradually involve researchers. To accomplish that we systematically gathered feedback from them, and adjusted or approach to their contexts. We noticed that more experienced researchers showed greater interest, and took advantage of the collaboration to deepen their knowledge in RDM. The collaboration has branched, in some of the groups, to the definition of a data management plan, to the creation of metadata models for their domain, and to data description in the Dendro platform, along with experiences with other tools besides the repository platform.","refs":[]},{"text":"Even considering some challenges, most researchers were willing to deposit their data, recognizing the advantages. Once the deposit was completed, we asked researchers to comment on the overall experience and its impact on their RDM awareness. To this end, an informal email was sent with several questions about the experience. Their opinions were written in Portuguese, which we freely translate here.","refs":[]},{"text":"Some researchers confirm that their datasets were shared by others and cited in scientific articles: \"Yes, I have shared my dataset several times with other researchers and for project proposals\"; \"We have used the dataset link in our papers\", yet they point out the lack of a mechanism to show information about the downloaded datasets: \"I think our data was not reused yet (or, if they were, we are not informed)\", therefore \"It would be useful to have some idea of how many times the data was downloaded \". Currently, the repository does not provide download statistics.","refs":[]},{"text":"Most people state that with each deposit they have gained more confidence and motivation: \"At first I found it hard, but as we go it becomes much easier and simpler \". Moreover, some of them highlight the importance of having assistance: \"The process itself is a bit time consuming. The choice of descriptors is not something for which we are oriented and the support of the curator is fundamental here\". In other words, they have improved their skills in describing data, each time the description process takes less time and fewer corrections, and researchers become more engaged and independent in RDM activities.","refs":[]},{"text":"In most cases researchers showed their datasets to others, promoting the INESC TEC data repository at the same time -\"Yes, once or twice I have recommended the deposit of data in the repository\".

This is also regarded as the starting point in RDM training activities, leading researchers to understand metadata terms and standards and familiarizing them with RDM tools. In order to further our approach and the kind of collaboration described here, we still have to address specific data description requirements to improve the overall quality of the metadata. This will probably lead to an extension of the proposed metadata form. Moreover, given the experience gathered with these examples, we have to continue our work and focus on helping researchers make their data fit for reuse.","refs":[]},{"text":"Although the Dublin Core elements have provided satisfactory results and good feedback, they have also revealed cases where the metadata requirements, or researchers' expectations, are not quite fulfilled.

Future work will address those requirements, with incremental adjustments to our dataset deposit form, allowing researchers to choose from or to add more descriptors. In addition, work also proceeds on workflows with more substantial involvement of researchers and more work on the definition of metadata models.

A simplified data deposit process is illustrated here by means of a set of examples where researchers describe their data and complete the publication in the repository. The process is organised around a Dublin Core-based dataset deposit form, filled by the researchers as preparation for data deposit. The contacts with researchers provided the opportunity to gather feedback about the Dublin Core metadata and the overall experience.
