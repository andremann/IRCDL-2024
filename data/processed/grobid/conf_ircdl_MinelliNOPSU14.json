The new generation of smart-phones and tablets offer new paradigms of fruition of CH goods: These devices provide a wide range of applications and functions, enabling 'communication', knowledge creation and fruition. New social skills are emerging, users create new forms of content through narration, they share knowledge, they follow emerging experts, they express what they like/dislike. Cultural institutions too express the need of new communication and collaboration paradigms and instruments. A collection of digital items such as images, videos, documents, does not constitute a digital exhibition: only when the items are carefully selected to illustrate a topic, and are tied together forming a narrative or a logical itinerary, they constitute an exhibition. Online digital exhibitions, independently of the degree of sophistication of the technology used, can be put together in such a way that they can provide alternative or extending denser experiences to the real event, which can involve the user in a process of discovery, knowledge acquisition, and learning of the cultural goods preserved in museums or outside in the territory or finally completely digital. In 2011, MiBACT edited the guidelines for realising digital exhibitions, a handbook successfully translated in English and even in Arabic. Consequently, thanks to a funding of Fondazione Telecom Italia, ICCU coordinated the development of an open-source tool called MOVIO, which allow cultural institutions to edit and publish digital exhibitions and to tell stories. The tool supports multilingualism in the back and front-end. The curator may edit the contents using different tools integrated in the software: amongst other, a media archive, an ontology builder, a storyteller, different types of galleries, images with hotspots, maps, timeline etc.","refs":[]},{"text":"During the AthenaPlus project (www.athenaplus.eu), a European funded project coordinated by ICCU and composed by 40 cultural partners including museums, libraries and archives from 21 Member States countries MOVIO will be further developed in order to include tools to facilitate the reuse of content in the field of education and tourism. It will also include a Europeana API, which will be the base to allow digital curators to enrich content.","refs":[]}]},{"title":"From the state of the art to the MOVIO project","paragraphs":[{"text":"In 2011, ICCU, in collaboration with the Istituto centrale per gli archivi and the Osservatorio tecnologico per i beni e le attivit√† culturali, published the guidelines for the creation of digital exhibitions on-line. This book collected contributions from a working group of experts from museums, libraries, archives, institutions and other cultural organizations. The guidelines analysed the state of the art of digital exhibitions made available on-line, and pointed out best practices and methodologies of a new way of narrating cultural content exploiting the opportunities of the new media and the Internet. After three years from the publication of the guidelines, the user demand for a new approach of publication of cultural content is still unattended in a satisfactory way. As a consequence, ICCU supported the set-up of a project addressing the recommendations written in the above mentioned handbook: a platform enabling all institutions, independently from their nature (public or private) to create and publish easily cultural narrations with personalized paths (for experts and non experts) and providing access to local cultural resources, let it be well known works of art or 'unexplored'. The project has been supported by Fondazione Telecom Italia with the focus of the valorisation of 'invisible' cultural heritage: MOVIO has been one of the seven winners of the competition funded by the foundation. The clear needs of museum curators was going to be addressed through a toolkit enabling internal personnel, with no IT skills, to create a digital exhibition safeguarding the exhibition logics and semantics and moreover enabling the emerging of collections and knowledge. The goal was to allow this toolkit to be freely accessible and interoperable and we decided to open it to the communities of developers by using the open source model. We expect that in particular small institutions (including museums, archives, libraries, archaeological areas, etc.), which typically have no resources to manage on-line valorisation models, to take advantage of this platform. The exhibitions are often the only occasion to reach the end users (schools, researchers, and general public) but still, the traditional exhibitions can only expose a small part of their collections, which remains hidden and unexplored. The think thank of MOVIO was aware that this toolkit should be innovative but also enabling the museums to do the digitization and cataloguing of their archives: we supposed that MOVIO should be an instrument supporting and integrating daily work, and as such we aimed to create a platform which should solve other issues than just publishing. Or better, we supposed that institutions would need first a media archive, to be able then to publish their collections.","refs":[]},{"text":"In 2011, CulturaItalia and OTEBAC examined 4,000 interviews on an heterogeneous sample of population and evidenced that 70% of them were interested to look for information about museums and exhibitions through the Internet and among them 68,2% would prefer to look such information on websites managed by public and institutional subjects; over 2,800 answers, 82.5% would access digital exhibitions for personal amusement, 24.1% for work, 31.5% for study and research. In 2010 the Marcus Institute for Digital Education in the Arts (MIDEA) published the Horizon Report, the museum edition, which described the technologies, which could best support the museums activities in the near and long term future. Clearly the report put into evidence the mobile applications, the social and community interaction, the augmented reality, the natural interaction, the semantic web, the 'big' and open data and the applications using localized information. The educational edition published in the same year, addressed the technologies which best supported education and research and school activities for learning. All scenarios present a growing use of digital and mobile technologies lead by a massive and exponential growth of content on-line (images, text, video) made accessible in an ubiquitous way for leisure, work and study. Finally, another fundamental reference for our project is the Analysis of the consultation launched by the Green Paper on \"Unlocking the potential of cultural and creative industries\" published in 2011 by EC, which faced the policy and economical implications for the cultural industry where more than 5 million persons are employed in the 27 member states. The cultural contents are crucial for the growth of the information society feeding indirect other connected markets (such as telecommunications, consumer electronics etc.) and all creative industries.","refs":[]}]},{"title":"Digital exhibitions and thematic paths","paragraphs":[{"text":"Before describing the MOVIO toolkit and how to build a project, we recall the definition of 'digital exhibition' (DE) and 'thematic path' (TP) provided by the previously mentioned guidelines.

More content can be offered to a more demanding public whose need is not just raw massive data, which overwhelm the commune user, but a guided navigation through 'thematic paths' and authoritative content.

All these user communities can access different levels of the cultural content (from easy and generic to professional and technical) going more in detail on any topic generated by the curators who can decide, and be creative. As an instrument addressed to a large and heterogeneous community, MOVIO has been implemented following rigorous accessibility standards (such as W3C, HTML5), interoperability with other existing cultural web sites and with the goal to be used and managed by subjects with no IT skills. These important characteristics have been planned and realized after a long collaboration of the project team with the Italian MiBACT: MOVIO is the new born from past collaboration projects after the wide adoption by museums and institutions in Italy of the \"Museo&Web CMS\", which is an open source CMS platform supporting on-line cultural sites publishing.","refs":[]},{"text":"At the start of the MOVIO project a team of domain experts worked on the experimentation, refining the user requirements, testing ongoing functionalities and a community of real users (curators) created DE on local collections.

While the development is continuing several DE have been already completed and published while many others are in progress also at European level.","refs":[]}]},{"title":"MOVIO is a Semantic Content Management System","paragraphs":[{"text":"The curators need a Content Management System in order to publish any form of structured narrations, a media archive where they can collect and manage their multimedia content files. This is a prerequisite. MOVIO's first module is a native CMS which can be populated with content collections and from which the curators will easily search and select images, video, documents, etc. MOVIO provides at the moment a limited set of functionalities but it has been structured to incorporate easily further new functionalities and plug-ins. We imagine that the more curators will use MOVIO, the more new functionalities will be requested and implemented: MOVIO is unique not for its functionalities but for its semantic based approach and as such it is called 'Semantic Content Management System' (SCMS). In fact, MOVIO is the first platform offering to end-users the opportunity to build their ontologies and use them immediately without the need of IT expertise: the Ontology Builder allows in a simple way, to create Entities and Relations, which can be visually represented by a graph where the nodes are Entities and the edges connecting them are the Relations. The domain ontologies connect content entities having semantic correlations.","refs":[]},{"text":"We are aware that speaking about ontologies, entities and relations may frighten a wide category of users, that is why we need not describing them the architecture nor the mechanics of MOVIO: in a very short time curators get confidence of it by using it and they are no more thinking about a complex semantic infrastructure.","refs":[]},{"text":"MOVIO can be easily installed even if it is a server side platform, and we are targeting to further simplify the setup by creating remote installation procedures.","refs":[]},{"text":"SCMS MOVIO integrates third parties Open Source components and libraries to enrich its functionalities.

Among them we describe here the Ontology Builder and the Storyteller.","refs":[]},{"text":"The Ontology Builder is the tool for managing the conceptual map of the contents to be published, creating relations among the Entities (to which the curator may associate documents, images and other media). The Relations between Entities are expressed by verbs: this guarantees the correctness of the logical path connecting them. The curator will draw by hand a draft conceptual map of Entities and Relations in the semantic domain of the DE. As soon as the conceptual map has been defined, the curator will start to use MOVIO creating the relations first and the entities later. The final result of the map can be visualized by the curator (from the back-end) and by the end user from the front-end. The user can access the list of the contents represented by an Entity, simply by clicking on it. Each content item can then be navigated in terms of description and eventually be played (for videos). The curator creates cards and descriptions thanks to the Module Builder that allows the curator to create a personalized metadata schema describing the exhibition and include textual description, photographic galleries, visual media play, etc.","refs":[]},{"text":"The Storyteller is an instrument to narrate stories. Three are the main ingredients of the storytelling: the story (in DE we use digital media contents); the author/storyteller (in the case of DE this role is performed by the curator); the public (who will read, listen and, interact socially commenting, etc.). As such, the MOVIO SCMS is the most adequate instrument for having a digital continuation of the storytelling tradition with the added value of public direct involvement. To best follow the storytelling process, we decided to design a vertical sequence template, which presents on the narration line texts, video, images, etc. In-depth contents will be linked by means of the Ontology Builder and as same as in Blogs, each narration item has a permalink to be quoted or shared as a single relevant piece of knowledge. Each DE has typically a descriptive form to be filled (similar to the card which describes the real exhibition), including an identification reference, a title, an author (the curator). The card describing the DE is useful both for the curator and for the end user who will access soon to a 'library of DE'. This is the future evolution of MOVIO: MOVIO-HUB will collect all DE and offer them to the users on a virtual hub. We created the card template following the guidelines provided by a working group active in the European funded projects Linked Heritage and AthenaPlus.","refs":[]}]},{"title":"Conclusions","paragraphs":[{"text":"In March 2014, the first phase of the MOVIO project was finalized.
