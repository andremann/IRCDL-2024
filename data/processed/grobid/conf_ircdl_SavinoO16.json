The increasing interest in it is testified by the growing number of film-induced tourism related initiatives undertaken at international level by public and private bodies, which developed movie maps and movie tours or exploited the success of a particular movie as a tool for destination branding [2].","refs":[{"start":200,"end":203,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b0"},{"start":899,"end":902,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b1"}]},{"text":"The Department of Cultural Heritage of the University of Padua recently investigated the topic of film-induced tourism in a project that brought together the expertise of film scholars and computer scientists; the goal of the project was to develop an information system that combines the data about a geographical area and the movies produced in it with the purpose of fostering film-induced tourism.

The idea is to record not only the places seen during the movie, but also other information like the actors on screen, any interesting objects on the scene, the emotions evoked, and to relate them to the specific portion of the movie they belong to. All these information can be then used to search and explore the data stored in the system, allowing the users to access and organize them in a manner that best suits their own needs. Figure 1 depicts an excerpt of the ER diagram, where the main entities and their relationships are represented. Each MOVIE is referenced by number of excerpts (ESTRATTO) selected by the film scholars according to their artistic relevance and by a number of moments-of-interest (MOI) that are short sequences selected according to their touristic interest. Both ESTRATTO and MOI have a relationship with one (the former) or many (the latter) points-of-interest (POI), that is georeferenced locations that are related to the MOVIE (setting, filming location). Each MOI shares a CLIP with one ESTRATTO. Searchable information is stored in full text descriptions (TESTO), information about involved persons (PERSONA) and keyword-based descriptions (TAG). Once the model was finally implemented and we started to populate it, we had two big challenges to face: the first was how to enable the system to organize and relate the data and the second was how to present them to the different users. In particular we were interested in building a system that was attractive and informative to the tourists user group; true to our intent to promote tourism through cinema and also to promote cinema through tourism, we wanted our system to enable the user to explore both the geographic space and the cinematographic space, creating an engaging, culturally rich, experience.","refs":[{"start":19,"end":22,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b5"},{"start":766,"end":767,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_0"}]},{"text":"In Sect. 5 we describe the solutions found to organize and explore the data; in particular we will describe how we implemented the search function, the user profiling and the recommendation system.","refs":[]}]},{"title":"Related Work","paragraphs":[{"text":"While little or no works can be found in literature approaching the topic of film-induced tourism from the perspective of information systems and digital libraries, the proposed approach shares some common elements in the way user experience is modeled and in the way the search and recommendation functions have been developed.","refs":[]},{"text":"The idea that users movements in a place, either the inner space of a museum or the open spaces of a city, can be classified according to user interest was first introduced in [7].

In order to provide data that could be useful for every user, we developed a system capable of storing a lot of information and we started to gather and produce these data, collecting them from archives, writing descriptions, geo-referencing and annotating movies.","refs":[{"start":688,"end":689,"marker":"table","target":"#tab_0"}]},{"text":"To make this content accessible, we need also to develop an adequate interface, enabling all user groups to reach the information they wanted.

A path is a sequence of pieces of information extracted by our database, e.g. the general description of a movie, the profile of a director, a geo-referenced video clip of a movie; each step of a path is related to the subsequent one by some means as for example spatial proximity or content similitude. While populating the database, the content is created in such a way that all the data in the database is geo-referenced or it is related to a geo-referenced element (e.g. a director has a 1:N relation to the locations used in all his movies).","refs":[]},{"text":"The user can follow a predefined path, whose content has been selected by film or tourism experts, and thanks to the geo-reference embedded in each part of the path, if the user is equipped with a mobile device, he can actually follow the path, using our system as a guide to explore the geographic space around him. Conversely, the user can explore the area and let the system enrich his visit by providing geo-localized information about the surrounding context; this way to explore the data can also be simulated by virtually navigating an online map and does not require the user to actually walk around. A search function enables the user to query the database for a specific text (e.g. name, place, keyword); each search result is a possible starting point of a path that the user can begin to follow to explore the database.","refs":[]},{"text":"Most of the content in the database has more than one relation with other contents (e.g. a place or an actor appearing in different movies); on the one hand, this lets the user branch off a given path at any moment and start a different one; on the other hand, this often requires the system to filter the amount of choices offered to the user, to avoid overwhelming him/her. The filtering module tries to minimize the number of choices and, at the same time, to maximize their diversification, to encourage the user to explore new content; with respect to this, offering a loosely related option is not considered an error as it adds a sort of serendipity to the exploration of the data.","refs":[]},{"text":"To make the experience more customized, some personalization has been implemented in the filtering: users are profiled depending on their previous searches and choices and the content suggested to them through recommendations is influenced by the profile associated to the user. The users belonging to the second group are less likely to need all these functionalities; for them we opted to offer a software interface instead of a graphical interface: by providing a list of APIs, tour operators and destination managers can access the data stored in the database with their DMS or other software. The APIs give access to some data that are not visible from the user interface described above because of scarce interest to the tourist (e.g. copyrights holders).","refs":[]},{"text":"The requirements of the users in the third group are a mix between those of the first two: they can use some of the functionalities provided by the GUI (e.g. the geographical exploration, the visualization of clips) but they are also interested in some data that is not provided to the tourist (e.g. the list of professionals who worked in a production). To accommodate these needs, we decided to offer a signed-on access to the website: once logged in, this particular type of user is recognized and the GUI shows the extra information needed.","refs":[]},{"text":"In the following section we will describe how we implemented the interfaces described above, with particular detail to the techniques used in the development of that for the first group of user.","refs":[]}]},{"title":"Implementation of the Solutions","paragraphs":[{"text":"As highlighted above, the key features to make the system appealing to our intended users are to have a lot of data, to have them accessible and, possibly, related to each other.

The search engine has been developed within the project and it handles single word searches and multi word searches separately. The first case is the simplest: the word is searched for an exact match in the indexed tables of the database, with the exception of the tables POI and PERSONA, where it is searched for an approximate match to account for the cases where the word is a part of the name of a place (e.g. \"Piccadilly\" in \"Piccadilly Circus\") or part of the name of an actor (e.g. \"Loren\" in \"Sofia Loren\"); if the word has a match with the name of an actor, the search is extended including all the characters associated to that actor. In the case of a multi word search string, the whole string is first searched for an exact match in the tables TAG and PERSONA and as an approximate match in POI, then the string is tokenized and a single word search is started on each token. The search is performed as case insensitive and a classical stop-list is used to remove parts of speech (pronouns, articles and prepositions) from the computation.","refs":[{"start":177,"end":178,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_1"}]},{"text":"The output of a search is a list of clips to watch; if searching for a director's name, a link to a description and filmography of the director is added to the results.","refs":[]},{"text":"To order the results a score is assigned to each of them: the exact matches have full score; approximate matches are scored by a custom function that measures the similarity between the word found and the word searched for; for matches in tables other than PERSONA, POI and TAG, a value combining tf and idf is computed. Tokens have a lower score (computed as a fraction), as they represent a partial match; however if different tokens point to the same element, their score is increased.","refs":[]},{"text":"To rank the clips in the search result, the system takes also into account the scores assigned to them by the film experts (stored in the table MOI) and the ratings in the social media.

The search uses an auxiliary table containing each element of the TAG table plus the synsets related to it found iterating recursively on the lexical database. This table is populated automatically and it is updated every time the content of the database changes (e.g. a new movie is added); its contents however can be also manually checked and modified using a custom control panel that lets the administrator decide which synsets store in the table for a given tag.","refs":[{"start":174,"end":178,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b12"}]},{"text":"To make the user experience more varied and to invite the user to explore our database and discover new things, we developed a recommendation system. Once the user has selected a first content object (e.g. clicking on a search result, or on one of the predefined path), the system generates a list of related content that is proposed to the user to continue his exploration. As with the search results, recommendations are mostly a link to another clip to watch. To produce this list the system searches which contents have the same tags of the present one; this relies on the same table used for the query expansion, containing all the tags and their related synsets. Given a clip currently being watched by the user, the recommendations might include clips shots in the same place or in the surroundings, clips with the same actor or from the same movie, clips conveying the same emotions or showing the same object. In a way similar to the search results, recommendations are ranked and ordered; however recommendations are also filtered and limited in numbers, with the filter trying to propose an heterogeneous list of different choices (e.g. different movies, different places).","refs":[]},{"text":"Recommendations are ranked only on their scores and ratings; in the case the user is accessing the system from a mobile device and his location is known, they are also ordered by the geographical distance to the user.","refs":[]},{"text":"To improve the recommendations, we also implemented some user customization. Customization is used to modify the list of recommendations in order to make them fit more the user's interests; as such it is triggered once the user has chosen a first content. Inspired by the paper [7] we decided to model our users in three profiles:","refs":[{"start":278,"end":281,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b6"}]},{"text":"â€¢ Profile A: the user is more interested in the touristic aspect of his visit, i.e. he/she likes to explore the geographic space; â€¢ Profile B: the user is more interested in the cinematographic aspect, i.e. he/she likes to explore a movie; â€¢ Profile C: the user is in-between profile A and B, with no special preferences, he/she is simply attracted from what is good, interesting.","refs":[]},{"text":"Whenever a user accesses the system, the software proposes a list of recommendations that is balanced, i.e. containing an equal number of clips that are set far from each other (profile A: exploring the territory), clips that belong to the same movie (profile B), clips that have high ratings (profile C); once the user starts to explore the recommendations, the system records which choices have been chosen and biases later recommendation lists to contain more options of the type the user seems more interested in. At present, the user cannot manually adjust his/her profile although this is an important aspect that will be taken into account in future development (Table 2). The system was developed and is currently deployed as a closed beta. The architecture consists of a database to store and query the data, a storage for the video contents, both the movies to annotate and the clips, a server with a backend interface to annotate the movies, insert data and manage the system, and a frontend interface to browse and explore the data, aimed mainly to the tourist user group.","refs":[{"start":676,"end":677,"marker":"table","target":"#tab_1"}]},{"text":"The server was developed in PHP on a hosted Apache web server.

The database was implemented following the model reported above (see Fig. 1) and populated using the backend web interface; some auxiliary tables have been added to the DBMS to speed up the search of keywords and to cache the results of the matching functions.

Our choice was to store the data in the cloud using Amazon Web Services (AWS); in particular we chose the Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) due to its easy use and cheap pricing, compared to ad hoc video hosting solutions (e.g. Vimeo PRO). We converted all the video in a format supported by HTML5 (H264 video codec and AAC audio codec), and stored them as MP4 files, that are then streamed via http; to keep the location of the files secure, a PHP proxy is used to relay the video streams to the client device. The clips are automatically generated from the annotated source files; each clip, resized at 480p resolution and compressed, is less than 2 MB per 10 s, while a whole movie varies between 500 and 700 MB in size. The user interface is implemented as a website developed to be accessible by computers, tablets and mobile devices: this choice looked favorable to the development of specialized interfaces for these different platforms; the website uses Bootstrap to be responsive and jQuery to load contents progressively to reduce the amount of data sent to the user; we use Google Maps as the backdrop maps for the geographic contents, but the system can easily switch to other map services; the video contents are provided using the capabilities of HTML5, thus leaving to the users' clients the choice of the video player.","refs":[]},{"text":"As a design choice, the user interface is completely isolated from the server, exchanging data with it only through the APIs; the website is implemented in PHP executed on a different Apache web server; this server also runs the code for user profiling and recommendation generation.","refs":[]},{"text":"The website can be used both by logged and not logged users; logged users can access some specialized content (if enabled by the administrator); all users' activity is tracked and the choices made (i.e., which of the proposed contents is read first) are used to associate the user to one of the different user profiles described above.","refs":[]},{"text":"Another important feature of the GUI is the integration with the social media.
