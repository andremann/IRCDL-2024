The traditional search functionalities of DLs, such as Europeana 1 , consider that users express their information need through a natural language query, and the digital library returns a ranked list of digital objects. This approach works well on the Web, which may be intended as a very large DL where the objects of the search are pages rich in textual contents, images, video and interlinked each other. On the other hand, this type of traditional search functionality runs poorly on most DLs. The reason is that the digital objects contained in them (e.g. representations of books, manuscripts, photographs, videos) are not meant to be read and navigated on the fly like Web pages and the search is based only on the metadata associated to objects that are semantically poor. As a result, the response to a web-like query on a digital library is typically a ranked list of metadata descriptors. In our study, we aim at overcoming the limitations of the search functionality of current DLs by introducing a new first class search functionality: the narrative. The vision is that a user searching e.g. for Dante Alighieri -the major Italian poet of the late Middle Ages -in Europeana would obtain in response not the ranked list of objects concerning Dante Alighieri but rather a narrative about Dante, made up of a list of events that compose his biography, linked to the relevant objects of the digital library that contextualizes them.","refs":[{"start":103,"end":107,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b23"}]},{"text":"First of all, in order to introduce this new search functionality and to develop an ontology for representing narratives, we studied the Artificial Intelligence (AI) literature, and in particular the Event Calculus theory, to identify the logical components of narratives (e.g. events, actions, fluents, physical object, agents), and give their formal definitions.

Computational Narratology studies narratives from a computational perspective. In particular, it focuses on \"'the algorithmic processes involved in creating and interpreting narratives, modelling narrative structure in terms of formal computable representations\"' [10]. The term \"Computational Narratology\" (CN) can assume different meanings according to the research context. In particular, in the context of Humanities, computational narratology is defined as a methodological instrument for constructing narratological theories, extending narratological models to larger bodies of text, providing precise and consistent explication of concepts [24]. From a cognitive computing point of view, this term refers to narrative texts, computer games, and more in general, software developed using semiotic, sociolinguistic and cognitive linguistic theories [12]. In the Artificial Intelligence field, computational narratology refers to the story generation systems, i.e. any computer application that creates a written, spoken, or visual presentation of a story. Storytelling systems aim at reproducing a human-like narrative behaviour or at creating interfaces or game environments using narrative as interactive method. Some of the early storytelling systems are TALE-SPIN [22], UNIVERSE [17], GESTER [29] and JOSEPH [15] that changes the story grammars to create new stories. Other storytelling systems are MINSTREL [40], MEXICA [30] and BRUTUS [3]. These are hybrid systems that implement a computer model of creativity in writing. Recently, ontologies were used to generate narratives. For example, MAKE-BELIEVE [18] uses common-sense knowledge, selected from the ontology of the Open Mind Commonsense Knowledge Base [39], to generate short stories from an initial one given by the user. ProtoPropp [11] uses an ontology of explicitly relevant knowledge and the Case-Based Reasoning method over a defined set of tales.","refs":[{"start":424,"end":428,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b10"},{"start":807,"end":811,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b24"},{"start":1014,"end":1018,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b12"},{"start":1433,"end":1437,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b22"},{"start":1448,"end":1452,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b17"},{"start":1461,"end":1465,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b29"},{"start":1477,"end":1481,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b15"},{"start":1577,"end":1581,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b40"},{"start":1590,"end":1594,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b30"},{"start":1606,"end":1609,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b3"},{"start":1775,"end":1779,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b18"},{"start":1880,"end":1884,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b39"},{"start":1962,"end":1966,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b11"}]},{"text":"In FABULIST [33] the user supplies a description of an initial state of the world and a specific goal, and the system identifies the best sequence of actions to reach the goal.","refs":[{"start":12,"end":16,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b33"}]},{"text":"The concept of event is a core element of the narratology theory and of the narratives. People conventionally refer to an event as an occurrence taking place at a certain time in a specific location. Various models have been developed for representing events on the Semantic Web, e.g. Event Ontology [32], Linking Open Descriptions of Events (LODE) [37], the F-Model [36]. More general models for semantic data organization are the CIDOC CRM [8] and the Europeana Data Model [7]. Narratives have been recently proposed to enhance the information contents and functionalities of DLs, with special emphasis on information discovery and exploration. For example, in the CultureSampo project [13] an application to explore Finnish cultural heritage contents on the Web, based on Semantic Web technologies, was developed. This system uses an event-based model and makes links among events and digital objects. However, it does not allow visualizing the event and the related digital objects as a semantic network provided with the semantic relations that connect events and objects. Another example is Bletchley Park Text [28], a semantic application helping users to explore collections of museums. Visitors express their interests on some specific topics using SMS messages containing keywords. The semantic description of the resources is used to organize a collection into a personalized web site based on the chosen topics. In the PATHS project [9] a system that acts as an interactive personalized tour guide through existing digital library collections was created. In this system the events are linked by inherence relations. Similar to the approach of PATHS project, within the CULTURA project [1] a tool to enrich the cultural heritage collections with guided paths in the form of short lessons called narratives was developed. The Storyspace system [42] allows describing stories based on events that span museum objects. The system is focused on the creation of curatorial narratives from an exhibition. Each digital object has a linked creation event in its associated heritage object story.","refs":[{"start":300,"end":304,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b32"},{"start":349,"end":353,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b37"},{"start":367,"end":371,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b36"},{"start":442,"end":445,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b8"},{"start":475,"end":478,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b7"},{"start":688,"end":692,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b13"},{"start":1117,"end":1121,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b28"},{"start":1445,"end":1448,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b9"},{"start":1698,"end":1701,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b0"},{"start":1855,"end":1859,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b42"}]},{"text":"The OntoMedia ontology [16] allows annotating the narrative content of heterogeneous media through description of the semantic content of that media (e.g. literary texts, TV program).

Fluents are functions and predicates that vary over situations (e.g. location of the agent). Fluents are situation-dependent components used to describe the effects of actions. The fluents can be distinguished in: relational fluents and functional fluents. The former has only two values: true or false, while the latter can take a range of values. As a convention, the situation is the last argument of a fluent [21], e.g. Holding(G1, S0) where S0 is the situation. -Actions. Actions are changes performed by agents from a situation to another in a dynamic world.

EC allows reasoning over intervals of time and fluents are time-dependent rather than situation-dependent.

The relations between an agent and \"mental objects\" like believes, knows and wants, are called propositional attitudes, because they identify attitudes that agents can have towards a proposition [34]. Using the reification method, it is possible to turn a proposition into an object that could become an argument of a sentence (because only terms and not sentences can be arguments of predicates). -Narrative.

Furthermore, the CRM provides several sub classes of E5 Event which recognize types of event (e.g. E63 Beginning of Existence, E64 End of Existence, E65 Creation). These sub classes are useful to establish a first categorization of events. Furthermore, another advantage of the use of the CRM is the existence of CRMinf, an extension of the CRM, which we are evaluating for the description of the inference processes of the narrator. Indeed, we additionally considered to represent the inferential process of a narrator who reconstructs the events composing a narrative starting from the study of the primary sources, e.g. a scholar who studied Dante Alighieri's biography analyses primary sources and on the basis of them s/he identifies and justifies that a particular event has to be included in Dante's life. Our model aims at describing the knowledge provenance, i.e. the process of tracing the origins of knowledge [4]. Reconstructing the inference process is important to evaluate the trustworthiness of the knowledge. Using this information, users can determine the quality of the knowledge based on its derivations. CRMinf is a formal ontology supporting the explicit representation of contextual information about data. In particular, it aims at representing data attribution, scientific concepts of observation, inferences and beliefs. Generally speaking, CRMinf represents \"integrating metadata about argumentation and inference making in descriptive and empirical sciences 5 , such as biodiversity, geology, geography, archaeol-ogy, cultural heritage, conservation, research IT environments and research data libraries\"6 . The components of narratives defined in the previous Sections could be intended as a first conceptualization of an ontology for representing narratives. For this reason, we have started the validation of these components by partially expressing them in the CRM and by using them to formally represent some of the main events that compose the biography of Dante Alighieri, selected as case study. Our representation of the events of Dante's life is derived from a biography of the poet written by an authoritative Italian biographer of Dante.","refs":[{"start":1049,"end":1052,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b4"},{"start":1760,"end":1761,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_4"}]}]},{"title":"Conclusions and Future Work","paragraphs":[{"text":"In this paper we have described a study of the Artificial Intelligent literature, especially of the Event Calculus theory, in order to identify the formal components of narratives.
