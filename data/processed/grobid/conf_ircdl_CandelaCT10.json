He also identifies in interface standardization and interface bridging two of the major mechanisms for interoperation. Heiler [13] defines interoperability as \"the ability to exchange services and data with one another. It is based on agreements between requesters and providers on, for example, message passing protocols, procedure names, error codes, and argument types\". He also defines semantic interoperability as ensuring \"that these exchanges make sense -that the requester and the provider have a common understanding of the \"meanings\" of the requested services and data. Semantic interoperability is based on agreements on, for example, algorithms for computing requested values, the expected side effects of a requested procedure, or the source or accuracy of requested data elements\". Park and Ram [23] define syntactic interoperability as \"the knowledge-level interoperability that provides cooperating businesses with the ability to bridge semantic conflicts arising from differences in implicit meanings, perspectives, and assumptions, thus creating a semantically compatible information environment based on the agreed concepts between different business entities\". They also define semantic interoperability as \"the application-level interoperability that allows multiple software components to cooperate even though their implementation languages, interfaces, and execution platforms are different\" [26]. In addition to that they state that emerging standards, such as XML and Web Services based on SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol), UDDI (Universal, Description, Discovery, and Integration), and WSDL (Web Service Description Language), can resolve many application-level interoperability problems.","refs":[{"start":148,"end":152,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b33"},{"start":617,"end":621,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b12"},{"start":1300,"end":1304,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b22"},{"start":1907,"end":1911,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b25"}]},{"text":"As recognized by Paepcke et Al.

The paper focuses on digital library content interoperability, i.e. the problem arising whenever two or more Digital Library \"systems\" are willing to interoperate by exploiting each other's content resources. Different systems have to remove the barriers resulting from the different models and \"ways to manage\" underlying their resources. The aim is to contribute to a better understanding of this interoperability problem and the relative solutions through a systematic and organized approach. The paper refrains from introducing its own definition of content interoperability in favor of an Interoperability Framework aiming at identifying the various facets characterizing this exemplar of interoperability. By exploiting this framework, \"interoperability\" problems and solutions can be modeled in a multifaceted space.
