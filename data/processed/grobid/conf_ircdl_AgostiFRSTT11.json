The role of archival users is crucial for understanding the characteristics and peculiarities of archives and thus, for addressing the issues that arise when we move from traditional archives to digital ones. One of the most important aspects is that an archive is not simply constituted by a series of objects that have been accumulated and filed with the passing of time. Instead, it represents the trace of the activities of a physical or juridical person in the course of their business which is preserved because of their continued value. Because the archival documents are strongly connected with the creation and preservation environment the archives have to keep the context in which their resources have been created and the network of relationships between them in order to preserve their informative content and provide understandable and useful information over time. Archives are in fact made up of series which in turn can be organized in sub-series which are formed of archival units. This implies that each of these entities can only be correctly identified and interpreted in relation to the entity they belong to and from which they inherit certain characteristics [17]. The prevailing solution in the development of DAS was to represent these relationships with hierarchical metaphors which collocate each entity in a hierarchical relationship of subordination with the entity it belongs to -i.e. the archive is modeled by means of a tree structure.","refs":[{"start":1275,"end":1279,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b16"}]},{"text":"In this context, archival description is one of the most important tools that we have to consider when we have to deal with archives and it is defined in [12] as \"the process analyzing, organizing, and recording details about the formal elements of a record or collection of records, to facilitate the work's identification, management, and understanding\"; archival descriptions have to reflect the peculiarities of the archive.","refs":[{"start":154,"end":158,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b11"}]},{"text":"In a digital environment archivists are used to adopt a metadata standard to encode archival descriptions which is called the Encoded Archival Description (EAD). EAD is a standard released by the Library of Congress in partnership with the Society of American Archivists1 . It fully enables the expression of multiple description levels central to most archival descriptions and reflects hierarchy levels present in the resources being described. Furthermore, EAD reflects the archival structure and holds relations between entities in an archive. In addition, EAD encourages archivists to use collective and multilevel description, and because of its flexible structure and broad applicability, it has been embraced by many repositories [11].","refs":[{"start":270,"end":271,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_1"},{"start":738,"end":742,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b10"}]},{"text":"Thanks to these features EAD allows the archivists to represent and manage the fundamental characteristics of archives even in the digital environment. On the other hand, EAD allows for several degrees of freedom in tagging practice, which may turn out to be problematic in the automatic processing of EAD files, since it is difficult to know in advance how an institution will use the hierarchical elements. The EAD permissive data model may undermine the very interoperability it is intended to foster. Indeed, it has been underlined that only EAD files meeting stringent best practice guidelines are shareable and searchable [13]. Moreover, there is also a second relevant problem related to the level of material that is being described. Unfortunately, the EAD schema rarely requires a standardized description of the level of the materials being described. Therefore, access to individual items might be difficult without taking into consideration the whole hierarchy. Moreover, sharing and searching archival description might be made difficult by the deep hierarchical structure of EAD files. Indeed, each EAD file is a hierarchical description of a whole collection of items rather than the description of an individual item. On the other hand, users are often interested in the information described at the item level, which is typically buried very deeply in the hierarchy and might be difficult to reach. This approach does not allow us to change the metadata format used for describing the archival resources and it binds together the structure of the archive and the archival descriptions. In this way an archive is treated by a DAS as a monolithic unit that does not allow the very flexibility that archival users require [8]. Furthermore, the plain adoption of the EAD approach turns out to be a barrier towards the effective adoption of standard Digital Library technologies such as Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) [15] [8]. As described in [9,1], both the variable granularity and the crosslanguage access as well as the variable granularity exchange of archival metadata is precluded by this approach.","refs":[{"start":628,"end":632,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b12"},{"start":1736,"end":1739,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b7"},{"start":1967,"end":1971,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b14"},{"start":1972,"end":1975,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b7"},{"start":1993,"end":1996,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b8"},{"start":1996,"end":1998,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b0"}]},{"text":"In the SIAR project we chose to take into account both the positive and the negative aspects of archival practice and in particular of the EAD in order to envision an innovative DAS which allows us to represent and manage the fundamental characteristics of archives and at the same time to overcome some well-known issues.","refs":[]}]},{"title":"Analysis of the Requirements","paragraphs":[{"text":"The SIAR system is a Digital Archival System (DAS) that has to take into account the characteristics of the archives and their resources.

From the interaction with the archival users we understood that archival descriptions should adopt flexible and, if possible, extensible metadata format in order to deal with the heterogeneity of the archival resources. A DAS has to be able to manage different archival metadata formats at the same time. There can be the chance that a document has to be described in multiple ways by means of different metadata formats.","refs":[]},{"text":"The archivists pointed out that an archive is not only composed of documents and archival descriptions, but it also comprises the organizations, institutions, corporate body, families, people and preservation institutes that contribute to creating an archival resource -i.e. producer subjects -and to preserving and making it accessible -i.e. preservation subjects. Each one of these subjects has to be described by means of a proper metadata format. The archivists highlighted the importance of these descriptions and their relationships with the archival resources that they produce and preserve. We call these descriptions authority files and they can be seen as access points to the archival resources.

For this reason the possibility to access, update or delete a description or a resource has to be granted only to those who are explicitly authorized. Furthermore, there are relevant privacy issues such that the consultation of an archive has to be controlled and limited if necessary. Access with variable granularity has to be granted to the archival resources. Furthermore, a DAS has to be able to exchange archival descriptions with different degrees of coarseness and belonging to whatever level of the archival hierarchy without having to exchange the whole archive. Furthermore, it is required to have a mechanism available for reconstructing the archival relationships of an exchanged description whenever this is necessary.","refs":[]},{"text":"In the archival context, especially when we consider a multitude of smallor medium-sized organizations that need to describe and manage their own archives, it is very important to envision a DAS which is economically sustainable.

Therefore, in the SIAR system together with the archivists we designed an extensible metadata format for the archival description which relies on the Italian catalog of archival resources [17] developed in the context of the National Archival Portal2 . This choice allows us to use different kinds of metadata formats and at the same time to export the SIAR metadata towards the National Archival Portal.

The former requires documenting the archives and their documents; the latter requires creating data structures to meet the defined set of requirements. We defined the NEsted SeTs for Object hieRarchies (NESTOR) framework [10,2,5] which is composed of two set data models called Nested Set Model (NS-M) and Inverse Nested Set Model (INS-M); these two set data models allow us to model hierarchically structured resources by means of an organization of nested sets that is particularly well-suited to archives. The foundational idea underlying these set data models is that an opportune set organization can maintain all the features of a tree data structure with the addition of some new relevant functionalities. We define these functionalities in terms of the flexibility of the model, rapid selection and isolation of easily specified subsets of data and extraction of only those data necessary to satisfy specific needs. In Figure 2 we can see a graphical representation of the two set data models composing the NESTOR framework; they are related to the well-known tree data structure. The first model is the NS-M and it is represented by means of a Euler-Venn diagram which helps us to understand their main characteristics. In the NS-M every node of a tree is represented by means of a set and the hierarchical relationships between the nodes are retained by the order inclusion between the sets. The elements belonging to a set represents the resources belonging to a specific devision of a hierarchy. The second model -i.e. the INS-M -is based on the same foundational idea of the NS-M but it reverses its logic. We represent the INS-M throughout a graphical aid called the DocBall [16] that allows us to show the relationships between the sets in the inverse model. In INS-M every node of a tree is represented by means of a set -i.e. a circular sector in the DocBalland the relationships between the sets are retained by an inclusion order. The INS-M defines a set for the root of the tree and every other set created from the nodes of the tree are supersets of it; instead, in the NS-M all the sets created from the nodes of a tree are defined as subsets of the set created from the root. These differences allow us to point out different properties of the models and to choose the most appropriate one on a case-by-case basis.","refs":[{"start":358,"end":362,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b9"},{"start":362,"end":364,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b1"},{"start":364,"end":366,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b4"},{"start":1071,"end":1072,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_1"},{"start":1826,"end":1830,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b15"}]},{"text":"The set data models are independent from the tree but they are strongly related to it.

Indeed, by adopting the NESTOR Framework we represent each division as a set maintaining the hierarchical relationships by means of the inclusion order defined between the nested sets.

The data model provides us the possibility of changing the metadata format without affecting the structure of the archives or the functioning of the system. This feature was already exploited during the design and development of the system; indeed, the metadata schemas were revised during that time accordingly to new archival needs or in accordance with the new national guidelines released in the context of the National Archival Portal. Thus, this possibility eased the interaction between archivists and computer scientists, allowing us to reconsider design choices without changing the developed system in a substantial way. Furthermore, the instantiation based on OAI-PMH allows us to access and share the archival descriptions with a variable granularity and with the possibility of reconstructing the context of an archival description whenever necessary [10].","refs":[{"start":18,"end":21,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b8"},{"start":21,"end":23,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b1"},{"start":23,"end":26,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b9"},{"start":1551,"end":1555,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b9"}]},{"text":"The SIAR system defines two user roles: archival users and general users. The former can create, modify and delete the metadata, whereas the second one can only consult the metadata in the system. The archival part of the user interface provides users with several forms where they can insert and modify the archival metadata. These forms are shaped on the basis of the metadata schemas that were designed. Together with the archivists we defined some visual aids to help the user in the insertion of the archival descriptions -e.g. instructions about how to compile the fields of the forms, a graphical representation of the inserted archives where archival divisions can be added to the archival hierarchy or descriptions can be added to a specific division. The insertion of new archival descriptions is guided by the system; for instance, if the root of the archive is a \"fonds\" the children of this node must be \"sub-fonds\" or a \"serie\" but it cannot be another \"fonds\". We developed several controlled vocabularies to guide users in the description process.","refs":[]},{"text":"The SIAR system is developed as a Web application that can be accessed by means of a browser and thus it does not require any particular software or hardware infrastructure to be used. The SIAR system is thus freely accessible and usable by the archival users with the only requirement of the access to the Internet; this feature is very important from the economical sustainability point-of-view as it allows even small organizations distributed in the territory to make use of an open system for describing, managing and sharing their archival resources.","refs":[]}]},{"title":"The Laboratory Interaction","paragraphs":[{"text":"The laboratory interaction was crucial in the development of the SIAR system because it allowed us to verify if the archival requirements have been satisfied. The laboratory was conducted by both the archival and computer science components of the SIAR project; the former presented the choices made in the definition of the metadata formats to be used for the descriptions and the latter explained how the data model and the architecture of the system were designed and developed to meet user requirements. The users that used the SIAR system were asked to insert some archival descriptions about an archive in which they are working and also the metadata regarding the production and preservation subjects. Each step of the laboratory was characterized by a continuous feedback with the users.","refs":[]},{"text":"The archival users were able to insert all their archival descriptions highlighting some relevant aspects related to the description policies that the SIAR project has to provide. The users easily inserted several archival divisions exploiting the graphical aids provided by the user interface. They pointed out that the use of controlled vocabularies to help the insertion of the description is useful but at the same time it can be problematic. Sometimes archival descriptions have to go beyond the standard archival practice in order to describe some aspects of the archival reality that do not fit a standard model. For instance, there could be the necessity to create a sub-fonds as child of a serie and the system should allow this possibility. Another important observation regarded the definition of the authority files and their relationships with the descriptions; the users pointed out that the availability of a manual mechanism for defining the authority lists would be very useful for the archivists.","refs":[]},{"text":"The extension of the spectrum of user privileges in the system is needed to provide a greater differentiation of user roles -e.g. a user authorized to publish the metadata, a user that can revise the inserted metadata, a user that can insert new metadata that will be revised and published later on.","refs":[]},{"text":"A relevant topic of discussion focused on cross-language access to the archival resources; in the context of the SIAR system we have to consider that documents are written not only in Italian but also in Latin or in various forms of dialect. We need to analyze this aspect together with the archivists and verify which multilingual techniques we can adopt in the system.","refs":[]},{"text":"The discussion with the users highlighted that the some revisions to the user interfaces are necessary; a very important aspect is to define new paths to reach and consult the archival descriptions in order to help the general user to understand and have access to the archival resources.

In other words, it needs to allow archivists to also use SIAR as an aid in the phase of recognition, organization and initial description of the archival material and therefore not only as a tool for the final representation of already completed inventories. This implies that the archival structure being inserted needs to be easily adaptable and modifiable \"on-the-fly\" as the links between the various units and structures of the fonds become clearer in the archivists mind. The flexibility of the data model upon which SIAR is based makes it possible to dynamically reorganize the structure of the archive without modifying the descriptive metadata.","refs":[]},{"text":"The laboratory interaction has been a fundamental step that allowed us to define the order of priorities for the future activities that have to be carried out in the SIAR project.","refs":[]}]},{"title":"Final Remarks","paragraphs":[{"text":"The SIAR project is a relevant example of collaboration between archivists and computer scientists for the design and development of a Digital Archival System which takes into account both archival and technical needs.
