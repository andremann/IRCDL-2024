One such functionality is an enhanced fruition that goes beyond 'simple' document retrieval based on lexical content or on the available metadata. For scholars and practitioners, but also for nonexpert end users, a very relevant component, full of interesting information, may be the context of the document as a whole, and/or of its content, that allows to put it in perspective and grasp a deeper understanding thereof. For instance, it might be interesting to know that a novel was first cited in a document that was found in a certain place of a certain country, and that a character in that novel was inspired to a real person, who was a friend of the author, who lived in a city, where an event took place that inspired him to write the novel. And, maybe, that the novel was used as the screenplay for a movie, which was shown for the first time in a certain theatre of a famous town, at the presence of some very important public persons. And so on.","refs":[]},{"text":"Of course, collecting, storing and using such information is not trivial, for several reasons. First, the knowledge to be represented spans through a wide range that goes beyond the typical expertise of researchers and scholars, also involving amateurs, collectors, and enthusiasts. Also, the available knowledge may be scattered and spread across many persons, each perhaps knowing just part of the story, or specialized only on some aspects of it. Moreover, satisfactory usage of the available information might involve complex information patterns and aggregates, that might be domain-dependent and different for the different kinds of users involved. In short, a switch from data bases to knowledge bases is needed, so as to allow a shared understanding of the involved concepts, to improve the reuse of the available information, and to enable reasoning tasks on it that return additional higher-level, non-trivial information. Leveraging the enthusiasm of practitioners in this field, a possible solution would be to adopt a collaborative approach for the building and enrichment of the knowledge base. In a wiki approach, the motivation to share knowledge would be the possibility of using also the information contributed by other people.","refs":[]},{"text":"However, a collaborative approach in which many people, with different expertise, culture, background and perspectives contribute small pieces that together make up the big picture, requires suitable schemes to represent and organize the knowledge in this field. From a traditional database perspective, these schemes are the table definitions. From the knowledge base perspective, these schemes are typically in the form of ontologies. Since this paper aims at merging both perspectives, we need a solution that may serve both as a database schema and as an ontology. Unfortunately, due to the very different traditional approach to data management in digital libraries and archives, the currently available resources, developed in the cultural heritage landscape, are unsuitable. Hence, a need for a new scheme, to be shared and reused by all the stakeholders involved in this area of interest, which is one of the contributions of this paper.","refs":[]},{"text":"Handling the functionality described above requires an appropriate infrastructure, made up of advanced data representation and storage facilities, as well as of advanced information handling tools and algorithms.

Among them, the most popular and mature tool is prot√©g√©1 , based on the OWL-API, which is fully compliant with the OWL specifications by W3C2 . GraphBRAIN adopted the same OWL-API for its ontology export functionality, so that the generated ontologies are fully compliant with the standard and may be edited using prot√©g√©. We developed a specific ontology definition and handling tool for several reasons. First, it had to be embedded into GraphBRAIN's interface, so that the administrators could seamlessly and collaboratively build and refine the ontologies. Second, while existing tools are mainly aimed at defining formal ontologies starting from an RDF knowledge base model, our motivation was in the need to define a schema for the graph DB, and the translation in standard ontology format was a consequential objective in order to enable OWL reasoning capabilities.","refs":[{"start":209,"end":212,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b0"},{"start":269,"end":270,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_0"},{"start":354,"end":355,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_1"}]},{"text":"On the methodological side, some works exist that analyze the possibilities of cooperation between ontologies and graph DBs.

However, other resources are available for closely related topics. For instance, focusing on cultural heritage, and on the Italian landscape, Cultural-ON (Cultural ONtology) [11]. Very close to our perspective are also [10,14], concerning the development of a database relating movies to the places in which they were shot.

The knowledge base is implemented as a graph database, using the Neo4j [13] DBMS. Nodes and arcs may have associated attribute-value maps; nodes (representing individuals) may be labelled with one or many labels (usually representing classes), while each arc (representing a relationship) may be labeled with one type only. No schema handling is provided for by Neo4j, meaning that the user is totally free to use any type and/or attribute name for any single node and arc. While ensuring great flexibility, this does not allow to associate a clear semantics to the graph items. For this reason, GraphBRAIN requires its users to work according to pre-specified data schemes, expressed in the form of ontologies. Thus, a characterizing feature of GraphBRAIN is its bringing to cooperation a database management system for efficiently handling, mining and browsing the individuals, with an ontology level that allows it to carry out formal reasoning and consistency or correctness checks on the individuals.","refs":[{"start":10,"end":11,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_2"},{"start":324,"end":328,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b12"}]},{"text":"The administrators of the knowledge base may build and maintain the general and domain-specific ontologies by specifying the types of entities and relationships to be considered, each with its attributes and associated datatypes. The universal class is implicit, so the user must start the ontology description from the top-level classes, which are automatically considered as disjoint by the system. Each top-level class may be the root of a hierarchy of subclasses, for which no assumption about disjointness is made. Some classes and relationships may appear in different ontologies, possibly with different attributes, in order to reflect different perspectives on them. In particular, GraphBRAIN provides a top-level ontology, defining very general and highly reusable concepts (e.g., Person, Place) and relationships (e.g., Person.wasIn.Place). It plays a crucial role to interconnect the domain-specific ontologies, ensuring an overall connected knowledge graph. Indeed, there is a single, shared graph underlying all the domains. Thanks to the classes shared across different domains, this allows the system to reuse knowledge across domains, and thus to reach a wider range of outcomes for satisfying the user information needs. So, if an individual is used by different ontologies, it acts as a bridge among those ontologies, allowing the users of a domain to obtain additional information coming from other domains.","refs":[]},{"text":"The ontologies are saved in an internal format, used as a schema for the graph database.

Currently, it can serialize them to Ontology Web Language (OWL) 4 format, with namespace prefix lam, so that it can be published and exploited for ensuring semantic access to the knowledge base and make it interoperable with other resources. The tool models the particular case of different collection types by declaring some specific OWL classes and sub-properties. For example, object property lam:belongsTo has concept lam:Collection as the range, but several disjoint classes as domain (e.g., lam:Person and lam:Document). The tool defined one sub-property of lam:belongsTo for each of these domain classes. In this way, instead of having a generic property: GraphBRAIN uses the ontologies to drive and support knowledge base creation and enrichment, plus all other functionalities, including a set of advanced tools for searching and browsing the knowledge base, and a set of mining, analysis and knowledge extraction tools that may be used interactively by end users or provided as services to other systems for obtaining selective and personalized access to the stored knowledge.","refs":[{"start":262,"end":263,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_3"}]},{"text":"Information is fed into the knowledge base by interaction with users or by automatic knowledge extraction from documents and other kinds of resources (e.g., the Internet).

The forms are automatically generated by the system from the internal format specification of the ontologies. For this reason, albeit GraphBRAIN may handle several ontologies, each specifying a different domain, the form-based interface for data management and querying requires the user to select one of the available domains in order to load the corresponding scheme/ontology to be used (Fig. 1, top-left). While the knowledge base content may be published as linked open data (LOD) [7], it is not available in its entirety as LOD. Indeed, it is accessible only through the querying and graph browsing facilities in the on-line interface, or through pre-defined tools exposed as services, that, based on their input parameters, return relevant portions of the graph serialized as RDF.","refs":[{"start":213,"end":214,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_1"},{"start":272,"end":273,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_1"},{"start":320,"end":321,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_1"},{"start":813,"end":814,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_1"},{"start":903,"end":906,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b6"}]},{"text":"Additional functionality is also provided.

Second, users may add comments, or approve/disapprove, each entity or relationship instance, and even each single attribute value thereof. This can be used to ensure some kind of 'distributed' quality assurance on the content of the knowledge base, and to establish a trust mechanism for the users. Using the comments, the users may also provide useful suggestions to improve and extend the ontologies. Also, users are encouraged to provide high-quality knowledge, because using a combination of their number of contributions and trust they are assigned 'points' that they may spend in using advanced features provided by GraphBRAIN.","refs":[]},{"text":"The same form-based interfaces can be used to query the knowledge base for instances of entities and relationships.

This is useful to explore the available knowledge without a pre-defined goal in mind, but letting the data themselves drive the search.

This shows that much relevant information in the library domain is in the relationships rather than in the attributes, which makes sense considering the strict interplay among several entities (documents, authors, publishers, places, categories, series).","refs":[]}]},{"title":"Sample Case Study","paragraphs":[{"text":"Since the system is already on-line, no specific evaluation or validation is foreseen for it, except for the exploitation in the tourism-related project, that is indeed contributing in highlighting and fixing problems, refining the ontologies and feeding knowledge graph, and identifying the aspects of the approach to be extended and improved.
