One of the building blocks of most analysis in visual arts is to find similarity relationships, i.e. link retrieval, among paintings of different artists and genres. These relationships can help art historians discover and better understand influences and changes from an artistic movement to another. Traditionally, this kind of analysis is done manually by inspecting large collections of human annotated photos. Unfortunately, manually searching over thousands of pictures, spanned across different epochs and painting schools, is a very time consuming and expensive process.","refs":[]},{"text":"In the last years, large-scale digitization efforts have been made, leading to a growing availability of digitized fine art collections (e.g., WikiArt 1 and the MET collection 2 ). This has opened new opportunities for computer science researchers to assist the art community with automatic tools to further understand visual arts. Automated painting analysis, in fact, is becoming increasingly important for several tasks, ranging from object detection [5] to artistic style classification [15]. The purpose of our research is to develop an automatic tool to be used to retrieve visual links within large digitized collections of paintings by using simple image queries. Relying only on visual patterns makes the approach desirable when difficult to collect textual metadata are either scarce or unavailable.","refs":[{"start":491,"end":495,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b14"}]},{"text":"The ability to recognize artistic styles and similarities in fine art paintings inherently falls within the domain of human perception. Understanding semantic attributes of a painting, such as content and meaning, in fact, originates from the composition of the shape, colour and texture features visually perceived by the human expert. Recent breakthroughs in Computer Vision, particularly in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), proved to be very effective to tackle the problem of learning meaningful representations from the low-level colour and texture features (e.g., [3,14]). For this reason, the proposed tool is mainly based on visual attributes automatically learned by a well-known CNN architecture, i.e. VGG. The resulting high dimensional representation is then embedded in a more compact feature space through the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Finally, similarities among paintings, i.e. visual links, are obtained through a distance measure in a completely unsupervised nearest neighbor fashion. The proposed method not only provides the nearest neighbors for each query image, i.e. those images more similarly linked to the input query, but it also allows the user to study historical patterns by means of graph analysis.","refs":[{"start":575,"end":578,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b2"},{"start":578,"end":581,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b13"}]}]},{"title":"Proposed Method","paragraphs":[{"text":"The method we propose is partly inspired by the research presented in [11] and [12].

The method assumes to have a large collection of digitized paintings of different artists and genres, as those nowadays collected in several museum Websites. The goal is to transform the raw pixel images into a new, numerical feature space in which to search for similarities among paintings. In order to obtain meaningful representations of visual attributes of paintings, we used transfer learning from a pre-trained deep Convolutional Neural Network. This practice is common and it is now usually preferred over classic approaches based on hand-crafted features in several perceptual domains. For example, it has been recently applied to the problem of Parkinsonian handwriting classification [7].","refs":[{"start":64,"end":65,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_0"},{"start":763,"end":766,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b6"}]},{"text":"The input to our system is thus represented by a 224 × 224 three-channels painting image, normalized within the range [0, 1]: this is the typical input expected by the CNN we used. In fact, each input image is propagated through a VGG16 architecture [13], pre-trained on the very large ImageNet dataset [6]. The main assumption is that if the original dataset is large and general enough, then the weights learned by the network on this set of data can be used to new, even completely different image datasets. VGG16 is a well-known CNN architecture which adopts 3 × 3 convolution and 2 × 2 max pooling throughout the network. All hidden layers are equipped with the ReLU activation function. To achieve transfer learning, we used the common practice to ignore the fully-connected layers stacked on top of the convolutional base and to extract the output features from the last convolutional layer. The network is able to construct a hierarchy of visual features, starting from simple edges and shapes at the earlier layers to higher-level concepts at the later layers. This approach is thus apt to obtain useful, semantic representations for the problem at hand.","refs":[{"start":250,"end":254,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b12"},{"start":303,"end":306,"marker":"bibr","target":null}]},{"text":"Once the features extracted by the deep network are flattened, they have still too high dimensionality (i.e., 25, 088 dimensions) to make the use of distance measures feasible. For this reason, we need to transform this high dimensional feature space into a more compact low dimensional representation given by the application of PCA. Dimensionality reduction techniques are tailored to this goal (e.g., [2]); PCA, in particular, minimizes the mean 2 distance between data points and their linear projections [8]. For instance, the first two principal components span the plane that is closest, in terms of average distance, to the data points provided as input. In our case, to achieve a good compromise between representation power and dimensionality, the original 25, 088 dimensional feature space is projected onto a reduced space of 50 features.","refs":[{"start":404,"end":407,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b1"},{"start":509,"end":512,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b7"}]},{"text":"The final search for visual links among paintings is performed in the reduced feature space in a fully unsupervised nearest neighbor fashion.
