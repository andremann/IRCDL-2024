Typically, users of the SoBigData eInfrastructure can discover and leverage any of the datasets, released within the SoBigData RI itself, or upload, document and share their owns. The SoBigData RI takes care of hosting, maintaining and granting full, seamless and open access to all the included datasets and methods. In this way, distinguishing features of the eScience and Digital Libraries paradigms, such as collaboration, interdisciplinarity, resource sharing, interoperability, open and seamless access and cost-effectiveness are fulfilled. Recently, another alluring possibility emerged, where end-users and stakeholders are directly given the possibility to build and share new personalized datasets -all within the eInfrastructure -without the need for technical expertise. This novel solution greatly empowers scientists and end-users of the eInfrastructure, thus ultimately further contributing to collaboration, interdisciplinarity and resource sharing, that are fundamental points of the eScience and Digital Libraries paradigms. The Twitter Monitor, integrated within the SoBigData eInfrastructure,that we describe in this section -represents one of the first examples of this novel approach. It represents a new data-entry point to the whole eInfrastructure, thus acting as a catalyst for collaboration and sharing between platform users. Given the aims of the SoBigData project, the Twitter Monitor allows easy data collection from social media sources, and in particular, from Twitter2 . Social media platforms are the most effective, sophisticated and powerful way to gather preferences, tastes, and activities of groups of users in the context of Web 2.0. In turn, this large amount of information may generate in-depth knowledge about topics of interest.

Systems exploiting participatory crowdsensing require intentional participation and must therefore provide incentives to the users to perform such actions. -Opportunistic crowdsensing: users spontaneously collect and share data as they go for their daily life.

The tool is able to manage concurrent monitors: it is possible to launch parallel listening sessions (i.e., more than one Twitter crawler at a time) with personalized parameters to collect different sets of data. The Twitter Monitor also offers a set of functionalities, aimed to minimize the loss of data due to network or local machine problems. It is also capable of alerting, detecting and recovering from errors, such as streaming connection failures. In particular, it can automatically handle rate limits imposed by the Twitter APIs4 .

It was implemented as a collection of modules. It leverages many functionalities5 made available by the SoBigData RI, which is build on top of the D4Science eInfrastructure [8], supported by the gCube software system [18]. The key benefits, allowed by the presence of the Twitter Monitor within the SoBigData eInfrastructure, are achieved via a combination of functions of the Twitter Monitor itself, and by means of a tight integration with the functionalities offered by the eInfrastructure. The main functionalities of the SoBigData RI, used in this application, are (i) the management of user interaction, (ii) the management of a user Workspace, (iii) the management of processing modules hosted on a set of nodes, and (iv) the management of database systems. The Twitter Monitor application is composed of three main modules: TwMonScheduler, TwMonCron and TwMonCrawler. In particular, the TwMonScheduler is visible to the users in the list of available Algorithms in the SoBigData environment. The TwMonCron is launched periodically by the SoBigData RI, by means of appropriate configurations. The TwMonScheduler is launched, when needed, by the TwMonCron by means of SoBigData RI APIs.

It displays a user interface for collecting the input parameters that will be used to filter the Twitter messages. The user interface is built by the SoBigData RI, based on settings specified by the module. In particular, the SoBigData RI calls a method setInput, that the module is required to implement. This method must define the list of needed parameters, along with each own type. Based on this list, the SoBigData RI displays, for each parameter, an appropriate widget to let the user enter the corresponding value. This module stores the parameters in a database called TwitterMonitorDB, managed by the SoBigData RI, containing a record for each crawler launched. The reference to this database is obtained by means of a service discover procedure: the ICFactory class is used to obtain a ServiceEndpoint, given the database identifier (in our case TwitterMonitorDB, unique among the SoBigData RI) and the needed credentials. The SoBigData RI finds the node on which the database is currently deployed, and it returns all the information that the TwMonScheduler actually needs to connect to the database. The database record also contains a unique identifier for the crawler, the state of the crawling process and a link to the final results. The TwMonScheduler periodically queries the database to check if the crawling process terminated, and, when the output result is available, it updates the user interface to notify the user with a message and with a link to download the output file. The output file is stored in the user Workspace available to each registered user so that they can also access it later.

Each time it is launched, it queries the Twit-terMonitorDB database to check the state of the crawling processes (called TwMonCrawler and described later). It manages to stop each process that reached its end time, and to start the new crawlers inserted by TwMonScheduler. It can also detect if some process has terminated before its end time, possibly due to an error. In this case, it launches it again. In order to check, start and stop the TwMonCrawler, the SmartExecutorProxy API is used: this API allows to manage the state of plugins independently of the actual node on which they are running. More than one TwMonCrawler can run on the SoBigData RI, and each one generally runs in a different node. The SmartExecutor API manages to run a new TwMonCrawler on the most convenient node, and find a particular instance of TwMonCrawler, among all the available nodes, given its unique ID.

It is launched by the SoBigData RI, on behalf of a TwMonCron request: it retrieves the crawling information from the TwitterMonitorDB database and runs a PHP script, as a separate process, providing it with all the needed parameters. The PHP process connects to the Twitter services to receive the selected messages, and it stores them in a local file. The TwMonCrawler continuously monitors this PHP process and, if it stops before the defined end time, it will promptly run it again. When the end time is reached, the TwMonCrawler copies the local output file into the user Workspace. This is done by using the HomeLibrary, that allows accessing the Workspace of the user who launched the crawling process. The JCRWorkspaceFolder API is then used to create folders (createFolder) and the WorkspaceUtil API is used to create files in the user Workspace (createExternalFile). The FolderItem.-getPublicLink creates an HTTP link useful to quickly download the output file, without traversing the Workspace folders. It also creates a link (functionality provided by the SoBigData RI) to this output file, and stores it in the database. The crawling process is finally marked as finished in the database.","refs":[]}]},{"title":"Twitter Monitor Use-Case in the SoBigData Research Infrastructure","paragraphs":[{"text":"In this section, we describe a simple use-case of the Twitter Monitor within the SoBigData RI.

We imagine a social scientist, with very basic Computer Science skills, trying to discover which are the most mentioned locations on Twitter related to the World Tourism Day (the 27th of September) trending topic. Firstly, we show a general layout of the SoBigData RI components involved in the process, namely the SoBigDataLab and the ResourceCatalogue VREs, summarizing the main available features. Secondly, we describe what the user should do to perform this task without the Twitter Monitor and SoBigData RI.
