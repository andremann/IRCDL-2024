A first definition of serious games was formulated by [1] and stressed the purpose as a key factor of those games, within the integration in the learning process: \"we are concerned with serious games in the sense that these games have an explicit and carefully thought-out educational purpose and are not intended to be played primarily for amusement.\" (in [1], p. 9). The intent, the educational purpose seems to be what makes a serious game. A second definition by [2] states that serious games \"have more than just story, art, and software (...) They involve pedagogy: activities that educate or instruct, thereby imparting knowledge or skill \". Even though the authors agree playing is always a serious matter, for our purposes we decided to focus on the pedagogical approach to serious games. NAVIGATE -Information Literacy: A Game-based Learning Approach for Avoiding Fake Content is an European ERASMUS Project (2017-2020) which aimed to include games in the university teaching of humanities students, with the objectives of improving their information literacy (IL) learning. This project was based on existing approaches in partner countries, extending and exchanging skills on three different disciplinary aspects: pedagogical aspect, content aspect related to information literacy and technological aspect.

NAVIGATE has started a collection of the best games that have been created for information literacy, producing a first registry in which they can be searched and rated, The NAVIGAME Searcher [5] The purpose of the paper is to understand how to improve the assessment of learning obtained with serious games. Games can be a platform for experimentation and interaction with something students wouldn't normally interact with. In the first produced NAVIGATE report \"Game design template\", the idea was to start mapping the parts of the search process where a game could play an important role for an entire class or for particular students.

Students need to know facts, concepts, rules and procedures. These are all different types of knowledge related to information literacy and, therefore, each requires a different type of game design technique to effectively convey that knowledge. Although there is no single definition of the learning mechanisms of information literacy (e.g. discovery, evaluation, experimentation), they represent a range of pedagogical intentions derived from the criteria of serious game pedagogy. Declarative Knowledge is an association between two or more objects facts, jargon, and acronyms. It requires a content to be memorized. Elaboration, Organizing, Association, Repetition and the used gamification elements are: Stories/Narrative, Sorting, Matching, Replayability. Conceptual Knowledge is a grouping of similar or related ideas, events, or objects that have a common attribute or a set of common attributes. The used instructional strategies here are: Metaphoric devices, Examples and non-examples, Attribute classification in a combination with the following gamification elements: Matching and sorting, Experiencing the concept. Rules-based knowledge is a statement that expresses the relationships between concepts. Rules provide parameters dictating a preferred behavior with predictable results.The applied instructional strategies are: Provide examples and Role play and the used gamification elements is: Experience consequences.

The NAVIGATE games were framed within an information literacy model designed by the project in the first phase of its implementation. Before selecting particular game mechanics, an original Information Literacy framework (Competency Tree) based on the SCONUL standard was developed as an information literacy model to direct the flow of game action (Fig. 1).","refs":[{"start":13,"end":16,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b5"},{"start":476,"end":477,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_0"}]},{"text":"The Competency Tree consists of 5 main areas related to Information Literacy and Avoidance of Fake Content each of them encompassing specific subareas.

In the game design process, the alignment of game aims, mechanics and strategies, and content to be learned was an important principle to be followed by the NAVIGATE team. Another belief was that immersive gaming features should be used with care to avoid unnecessary cognitive load. The team also believed that educators should have a pivotal role in contextualizing the gaming experience. To integrate the gaming element into the educational process, it is above all necessary to identify the learning outcomes demanded by the training, which also correspond to the types of knowledge that are necessary for the implementation of both daily routine operations and non-specific activities. To achieve this purpose, and to align the elements together, the team developed Learning Outcomes, Information Literacy Domains (Skills from the Competency Tree), and Types of Knowledge Matrix. Two levels of achievement (basic and advanced) were defined for the different types of knowledge.

However, these sorts of assessments and reports are providing only partial information with respect to the whole gameplay activities. The experience of the NAVIGATE Project has shown us that further research needs to be done on game assessment. Generally, gameplay is related to the way of playing games based on certain rules as a series of interactions and activities. According to [8,9], gameplay interactions can be tracked and analyzed in order to extract patterns and useful information for players and other stakeholders during the gameplay.

On the other hand, observing players interactions and having deep analytics on the obtained data would allow instructors and educational supervisors to realize how players apply domain knowledge, in addition to the effectiveness of the learning material and pedagogy that applied in the game. In particular, understanding behavior of students and effectiveness of learning are crucial in the purpose of improving learning practices and making evidence-based decisions to enhance learning outcomes for students. Also, for game designers it is important to understand how effective the gameplay is and how learning is aligned with the game mechanics to gain a maximum of learning and entertainment.","refs":[]},{"text":"Furthermore, to capture and evaluate players interactions during the gameplay, we would need a model capable of handling both learning interactions, to evaluate players learning performance, and further gameplay interactions. The latter could be highly revealing regarding players' behaviour, play and completion time and measuring how much game mechanics are responsive to the player's needs. In this context, two common approaches have been followed in the literature. Several researches have tracked only the significant change in the knowledge away from other considerations by assessing players' knowledge before playing and after playing using the so-called pre-test and post-test assessments [10,11]. Others have chosen instead to use some mixed methodologies to combine the pre-test and post-test with tracking and analyzing learning data and gameplay data to give a comprehensive understanding of players interactions [12][13][14][15]. Considering these research results and our previous work, we foresee the opportunity to expand the scope of NAVIGATE research introducing a NAV-IGAME Learning Analytics (NGLA) model (Fig. 5). The main objective of the proposed NGLA is to design, develop and validate a game learning analytics model in order to provide:","refs":[{"start":699,"end":703,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b9"},{"start":703,"end":706,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b10"},{"start":927,"end":931,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b11"},{"start":931,"end":935,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b12"},{"start":935,"end":939,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b13"},{"start":939,"end":943,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b14"},{"start":1133,"end":1134,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_4"}]},{"text":"proactive prediction for the students learning performance in future formal assessments to enhance motivation and guidance; -evidence-based decision for stakeholders to improve the educational practices; -profile-based recommendations of learning practices and materials to provide personalized learning paths.","refs":[]},{"text":"The proposed NGLA describes serious game learning analytics through five stages linked with the player model and supervisor model. The two models are giving more specifications to adjust the needs of each actor at each stage of the game learning analytics. while the five stages are starting from tracking the player profile data, learning data and other gameplay interactions followed by a data classifier to clean data and classify it according to each model. The third and fourth stages where the real processing and analysis are taken to reveal information and recommendations to the player and supervisor. Our intention here is to adapt and leverage upon the User Profiling and Recommendation System [16] to the needs and purposes of learning in HE. Finally, there is an Act stage where actions need to take place from players to follow the recommendations in order to improve their weaknesses, and/or from supervisors to improve teaching material and practices.","refs":[{"start":705,"end":709,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b15"}]},{"text":"Our research work will be based on relevant literature and on the lessons and experience gained in NAVIGATE.
