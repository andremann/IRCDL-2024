A typical scenario is the scholarship in the Arts, where contradictory opinions are differently addressed. Fairly common situations include: ignorance, where no true answer exists (e.g. the identity of Banksy); evolving data, where novel arguments or new information change the perception of correctness of claims; disagreements, where competing claims exist, they are reciprocally inconsistent, and no overwhelming justification towards one over the other ones exists (e.g. competing artwork attributions); lastly, challenges, where scholars present a claim they believe to be false or unacceptable simply to discuss it, point out its flaws and discredit it. To this extent, we can identify at least three types of claim that populate cultural heritage data: undisputed claims, which have not been debated (yet); disputed claims, whose correctness is currently under discussion and no clear conclusion has been reached (yet) about their truth; and settled claims, that were disputed in the past but then have been decided as true by the relevant community.","refs":[]},{"text":"Linked Open Data datasets in the Cultural Heritage domain present similar degrees of certainty of information.

A human would therefore be needed to clarify that these options are not all acceptable at the same time, that only one of these artists can be assumed, and that other claims are available for completeness but they should not be considered true. To this extent, superseded claims would rather need to be expressed without asserting (EWA), so that they can be contemplated without contributing to the truth value of the dataset. However, the lack of expressivity of datasets in conveying uncertainty leads to a great loss of information, and to an additional increase of complexity in the critical analysis that must be performed by humans.

A reified triple is not entailed, therefore complying with our minimum requirement. However, since it requires an expensive addition of triples (4+) and it does not allow inference on reified triples, it has been disregarded as a solution to describe provenance and it has been proposed for deprecation 3 [23]. N-ary relations (list. 3) are adopted in CIDOC-CRM. To represent concurring statements, instances of the class crm:E13_Attribute_Assignment are annotated with context information. This method shows some verbosity and redundancy of triples to add context to statements. Additionally, all statements are considered asserted, and therefore, in our example, the three attributions are equally asserted, despite the debate is settled toward only one. A singleton (list. 4) is a unique predicate that is used only once to represent a triple, instead of the original predicate. As such, it can be subject of additional triples. The property :singletonPropertyOf maps new predicates to the original ones. However, it is a subproperty of rdf:type, therefore the new statements must be considered asserted as well. Named graphs (list. 5) present a peculiar situation. It has been argued that graphs do not contribute in determining the truth of a dataset [17,18,24], which depends on the interpretation of the default graph. At least eight model-theoretic semantics [17] have been proposed to decide the truth value of graphs. No agreement exists, and several interpretations can be in place in the same dataset.

N3 syntax is compact. Since graphs in N3 do not have an identifier, the annotation must be performed in place. Yet, N3 graphs can nest at arbitrary depth levels, while RDF 1.1 graphs cannot contain other graphs. Recent works [18] have proposed the usage of N3 rules to bind graphs to one of the possible model-theoretic semantics. However, this would require parties to adopt only one serialization to serve and consume data, since N3 rules are not backward compatible to RDF. RDF* is a recent extension of RDF that allows a concise representation of statement-level metadata (list. 7). However, multiple statements, encapsulated in graphs, cannot be quoted. It is backward-compatible to RDF, requiring the specification of 6 to 9 additional triples for every quoted statement. In order to leverage all the potentialities of this proposal, bespoke languages (RDF* and SPARQL*) and technologies (RDF* graph stores) must be used.","refs":[{"start":729,"end":733,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b17"}]},{"text":"<< : p a i n t i n g -p r crm : P 1 4 _ c a r r i e d _ o u t _ b y u l a n : 5 0 0 0 1 1 0 5 1 >> crm : P 4 _ h a s _ t i m e -span : X V I I I _ c e n t . << : p a i n t i n g -p r crm : P 1 4 _ c a r r i e d _ o u t _ b y u l a n : 5 0 0 0 2 0 2 2 9 >> crm : P 4 _ h a s _ t i m e -span : 1 8 2 1 .","refs":[]},{"text":"<< : p a i n t i n g -p r crm : P 1 4 _ c a r r i e d _ o u t _ b y u l a n : 5 0 0 0 3 2 9 2 7 >> crm : P 4 _ h a s _ t i m e -span : 1 8 6 0 ; crm : P 1 4 _ c a r r i e d _ o u t _ b y u l a n : 5 0 0 3 2 6 9 4 8 .","refs":[]}]},{"title":"Listing 7: Competing attributions with RDF*","paragraphs":[{"text":"In summary, it is currently possible to achieve EWA respectively, with reification, N3 and RDF*.

Similarly to :singletonPropertyOf, the property allows to easily retrieve original predicates. However, the conjectural property is not a subproperty of rdf:type, meaning that the original statements are not asserted.

First, the original triples (i.e. those not using conjectural predicates) are not stated, thus fulfilling the basic requirement of expressing without asserting. Second, contradictory statements, each adopting a conjectural predicate derived from the same original predicate, are explicitly mapped to the original one through the conj:isAConjecturalFormOf predicate, which ensures clear identification and facilitates querying for unsettled disputes. Moreover, conjectural predicates comply with RDF semantics and only require a minimal increase of triples (one new RDF triple is added for every conjectured triple).","refs":[]},{"text":"In the introduction we identified (at least) three classes of statements that are of interest to scholars, namely undisputed, disputed and settled statements. Accordingly, we employ plain named graphs for undisputed claims (to be interpreted as asserted until a disagreement is recorded), and conjectural graphs for disputed claims (to be interpreted as expressed without positive assertion). Finally, a settled dispute is a statement that has been put in doubt by someone (and therefore disputed), but for which eventually a consensus was reached and the relevant community (and the dataset that expresses its point of view) record both the fact that the claim was disputed, as well as its subsequent assertion.
