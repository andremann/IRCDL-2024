printing was invented in the mid 15th century, a sort of transcription revolution took place all over Europe.

One of the most crucial steps for science in this modern media-revolution is the ability to search within texts. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology [1][2][3] has opened up even old printed texts to modern science in an unprecedented way. In libraries, meta-data is no longer the sole entry to collections, electronic content can speak for itself and this also changes library practices. However, the large mass of handwritten texts in our libraries and archives is still waiting to be transformed into searchable texts. The reason for this is a combination of technical and economic factors. Modern technology does not yet give us the good results of OCR technology, which nowadays can be so successfully applied to printed texts that it is a straightforward part of digitization processes world-wide.","refs":[{"start":348,"end":351,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b0"},{"start":351,"end":354,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b1"},{"start":354,"end":357,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b2"}]},{"text":"Handwritten text recognition (HTR) [4][5][6][7][8] is an emerging field and can be quite successful in certain circumstances, especially when applied to an even and uniform handwriting, but rarely so for the non-homogeneous handwritten texts that fill our archives. In most cases, manual transcription is still the most common way to produce reliable electronic texts from handwritten texts, but modern technology advances and many projects try to tackle this problem. Manual transcription is typically expensive and prone to human error. The incentives to open up this material to computerized searches is high.

Further, the user helps the HTR engine in marking words that are correctly identified and correcting misclassified words.
