E.g. librarians and IT specialists working for libraries with bibliographic formats (Marc, Unimarc) know very well that the relationship between authors' names and bibliographic descriptions is a many-to-many one, but in several individual research contexts bibliographic descriptions and authors' names are stored in two fields of the same table and when authors are more than one, different names are copied together in the same field. The consequence is that each record can be read by human eyes as on a page on paper, but data as a whole cannot be ordered and managed automatically.","refs":[]},{"text":"A too much scant attention to the relational structure can be observed also in other common practices.

For example it can be a discouraging experience to explain to humanistic researchers that the 'responsibility' a person has in a specific context (e.g. the responsibility to be the copyist of a document) is not to be considered a fixed 'qualification' of that person, because the same person can be a copyist in a context and an author in another one.","refs":[]},{"text":"Last but not least also recording different kind of information in a field designed for a specific typology of data, just because 'there is a blank to fill up', is a typical misunderstanding of individual research tools.

E.g. when a researcher is transcribing a series of prices from the same inventory, and each price is intended to populate a single record, a basic set of data shared by all the prices-e.g. the date, the typology of price, the place where that price was set -is inherited (although they can also be changed manually).","refs":[]},{"text":"-When information is already available online in free access repositories, such information can be imported automatically minimizing manual interventions. For this reason old books are not being catalogued by the EMoBookTrade team. Instead bibliographic descriptions are imported automatically from existing national and international catalogues and bibliographies such as USTC [8], EDIT16 [9], and VD16 [10]. -Numeric series (such as the order number of pages of a single catalogue) are entered automatically, although a manual change option is also available. -Researchers are not required to perform manual calculations, because multiple automated functions are made available instead. For example, for each edition considered, the EMoBookTrade DBMS calculates the price per printing sheet. This is made possible by a function that automatically divides the total price found in the source by the number of leaves, divided in turn by the volume's format. For example, if a given book carries the total price of 1560 denari and it is known to be an in 4¬∞ of 360 leaves (for a total of 90 printing sheets), the price per printing sheet will be 17.33 denari.

Any manual intervention made on a single numeric value will result in a consequent automatic readjustment of all the interlinked values. E.g. if a recorded total price needs to be corrected, because at a first glance the researcher misread the original source, the correspondent price per printing sheet will be automatically recalculated, and the same goes for exchange rates and so forth.","refs":[]},{"text":"Moreover several data, as they result from the interpretation of historical sources, cannot always be taken as fully reliable. For example sources may be damaged, misleading or carry incoherent information.","refs":[]},{"text":"At times, data can even be 'unidentified.' This, far from being a paradox, is a commonplace of historical bibliography. This is the case when a source cites a work without providing sufficient bibliographic data: e.g. 'Rime di Petrarca'. The given case does not allow to establish an univocal relation between the cited -and priced workand a known edition. In order to store information that are still valued by the researcher, the information regarding the price of the cited work will be linked to a fictitious bibliographic record (unidentified edition) based on the scanty information provided by the source: e.g. 'Francesco Petrarca, Rime'. Appropriate models of data, usability and effectiveness of the DBMS and the freedom to record also doubtful data, help researchers engaged in digital humanities to accept the introduction of new shared digital tools in their traditional environment. Without care of such issues, it is very difficult to develop and employ DBs and DBMSs in the field of humanities and in humanistic projects [11].","refs":[{"start":1036,"end":1040,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b10"}]}]},{"title":"The Future: Data Analysis","paragraphs":[{"text":"While the DB and the backend system described here are already working, the frontend -the public web site -is being designed.
