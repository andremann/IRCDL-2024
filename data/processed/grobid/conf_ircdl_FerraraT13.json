The concept of semantic relatedness is defined in the literature as the extent to which two concepts are related by semantic relations [17]. On the other hand, a possible definition of semantic similarity describes it as the measure which quantifies the extent to which two concepts can be used in an interchangeable way. According to this definition two semantically similar entities are also semantically related, but two semantically related concepts may be semantically dissimilar [3]. For example, the concepts of bank and trust-company are semantically similar and their similarity implies that they are also semantically related, but two concepts related by an antonymic 1 relation (such as the adjectives bad and good ) are semantically related and semantically dissimilar. According to [20], semantic similarity is a more strict relation since it takes into account a focused set of semantic relations which are often stored in lexical ontologies such as Wordnet. In Wordnet, for example, synonyms 2 are grouped in synsets and a hierarchical structure connects hyponyms and hypernyms 3 . On the other hand, the semantic relatedness between two concepts depends on all the possible relations involving them. For example, in order to compute the semantic relatedness between two Wordnet concepts, we should use all the available semantic connections by including, for example, meronomy 4  and antonymy. However, two concepts can be related by more complex semantic relations which are usually not explicitly stored in lexical ontologies. Think, for example, to the case of two concepts that are semantically related by means of a chain of more than one semantic relation, involving other 'intermediate' concepts. For example, the pair pope and Italy can be related through the chain pope → Vatican City → Rome → Italy. This kind of relations is not explicitly included in Wordnet as well as all the other possible relations which can be entailed between concepts which are not directly related by standard relations. Moreover, it has to be noticed that humans organize their knowledge according to complex schemas by connecting concepts according to their background knowledge and experience [8]. The reasoning task where units of meaning are processed by the human mind in order to identify connections between concepts is referred in the literature as evocation [2], which can be also defined as the degree to which a concept brings to mind another one. Evocation adds cross-part-of-speech links among nouns, verbs, and adjectives [14]. Since the human mind works under the influence of personal experience, the evocation process builds relations which may be not true in an absolute way (for instance the relations between emotions and objects/animals) and this is why these relations cannot be available in knowledge bases such as Wordnet.","refs":[{"start":427,"end":431,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b16"},{"start":777,"end":780,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b2"},{"start":1087,"end":1091,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b19"},{"start":2491,"end":2494,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b7"},{"start":2663,"end":2666,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b1"},{"start":2832,"end":2836,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b13"}]},{"text":"Obviously, all these aspects must be considered when we have to plan the evaluation of methods aimed at automatically quantifying the semantic relatedness (SR methods) or the semantic similarity (SS methods).

The dataset proposed by Rubenstein and Goodenough is constituted by only 65 pairs of nouns which cannot be used to exploit an extensive analysis for generalizing the findings. This limitation is partially faced by the Related353 dataset which is constituted by 353 pairs. -Terms instead of concepts. The datasets are build up by terms which do not identify concepts. On the other hand, SR methods compute the semantic relatedness among concepts such as the synsets of Wordnet or the pages of Wikipedia. The proliferation of senses in knowledge bases such as Wordnet and Wikipedia makes hard the task of manually associating a sense to each term included in a dataset [17]. Consider, for example, that the term love is associated to 6 synsets in Wordnet and, on the other hand, in Wikipedia the term love identifies several senses: an emotion as well as people, songs, fictional characters, and movies. For tackling this problem, it is possible to manually associate some of the terms of the considered dataset to the Wikipedia concept that, most probably, was considered by the evaluators.","refs":[{"start":678,"end":682,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b16"}]},{"text":"On the other hand, in order to avoid the need for manual disambiguation of terms, the semantic relatedness between all the possible senses of the two terms can be identified and fixed in the following way: the pair of senses with the highest semantic relatedness computed by the evaluated SR method is considered for assigning two specific senses to the two terms. Both these approaches are questionable since the judges were not conscious of all the various meanings of the words when they annotated the pairs. -Uncovered domains and semantic relations. The datasets created by Rubenstein and Goodenough as well as the Related353 dataset were defined with the main goal of covering many possible degrees of similarity. Following this idea, the authors used very general terms without taking into account the idea of choosing terms in different domains. This is limitation which prevents the generalization of the results. In particular, we highlight that the information provided or extracted from a knowledge base may differ according to the given topic. We can imagine that in Wikipedia, for example, some topics are described better than others. It is also possible that different knowledge bases (such as Wikipedia, Wordnet or other ontologies) may provide better results in different domains. For this reason it would be interesting to have datasets where pairs of terms are associated to domains or at least to have datasets where several distinct domains are covered. Similarly, a more reliable approach should also take care of covering a sufficient set of semantic relations. In fact specific SR method could be adequate for catching a specific semantic relation but it could not work with other relations. This information is obviously missing also in datasets created in an automatic way.","refs":[]}]},{"title":"Characteristics of the Feedback and Evaluation Procedure","paragraphs":[{"text":"The agreement among the evaluators is used in the literature for estimating the quality of the collected feedback: this follows the idea that higher is the agreement more reliable is the collected feedback. According to the literature, the level of agreement is sufficient to assess the precision of SR methods. However, there is not a threshold for the required agreement between the judges and this is also true for domain-dependent datasets. Moreover, also other features of the feedback collected from humans may greatly influence negatively the quality of the evaluation. More specifically, we identify the following points:","refs":[]},{"text":"-Pairs with low agreement. Different works use different strategies to manage pairs ot terms with low agreement among judges. An example of these pairs is (monk,oracle) in the Related353 dataset which was annotated by 13 evaluators who returned the following votes (7, 8, 3, 4, 4, 6, 5, 8, 6, 3, 4, 6, 1). In the majority of the works available in the literature these pairs are threaten exactly like the others, but in [15] the authors proposed to discard pairs with a very low agreement in order to have more significant results. Obviously, this idea can be applied only when the dataset is constituted by a large set of pairs. This is a very important issue since, as noticed in [3], the available datasets show a significant agreement only when the existence of the semantic relation is very clear (for instance the terms are synonyms or they are completely unrelated). -The choice of the scale. The choice of the scale for collecting the feedback is a controversial point and has a strong impact on the agreement among the judges. By adopting a very fine-grained scale the judges have many possible choices and they can provide more accurate responses. This was the motivation for the approach proposed by Rubenstein and Goodenough who also asked people to order the pairs in order to have more coherent responses. In fact, by ordering the pairs each judge could assign a decreasing list of values to quantify the semantic relatedness. However, this mechanism does not scale up to a large set of pairs since it requires a huge workload for ordering many pairs of terms. For this reason, in the task for acquiring the feedback for larger datasets like the Related353 dataset it is not asked to the evaluators to order the pairs. In this case, the humans could not rely on the order imposed to the pairs for assigning a vote and, consequently, it was harder for them to be coherent with previously assigned votes. For this reason, when the judges only annotate pairs of terms with a number it is better to avoid very fine-grained scale in order to have more consistent responses. -Bias introduced by specific communities. Different communities of evaluators may evaluate the semantic relatedness between two concepts according to different perspectives. This is clearly reported in [15] where the authors show that physicians and medics judged differently the semantic relatedness between terms in the field of biology. On the other hand, it makes sense to evaluate SR methods only on pairs where the feedback is not biased by the perspective of a specific community.","refs":[{"start":420,"end":424,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b14"},{"start":682,"end":685,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b2"},{"start":2285,"end":2289,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b14"}]},{"text":"-Metric robustness. The Pearson coefficient is a statistical tool used to catch the strength of the linear correlation between the human judgments and the score computed by a specific SR method. However, the correlation between the votes provided by humans and the SR method can be nonlinear. Moreover, the Pearson correlation is based on the assumption that the two compared random variables are normally distributed, whereas the actual distribution of the relatedness values is at the moment unknown [3]. On the other hand, the Spearman coefficient, which does not directly compare human votes with the results of the SR method, seems to be more robust.","refs":[{"start":502,"end":505,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b2"}]}]},{"title":"Toward a New Evaluation Strategy","paragraphs":[{"text":"In order to face the limitations described in the previous section we propose a new strategy for evaluating SR methods.

In fact, the experiments described in Section 2 showed that the agreement among the judges was significantly hight only when the pairs were composed by two synonyms or by two completely unrelated terms. Our hypothesis is that humans can perceive the semantic relatedness, but they are not used to quantify it by using a number. The difficulty in acquiring reliable feedback from humans is mainly due to the problem of having datasets constituted by terms which may be polysemic, i.e. having multiple senses. Starting from this assumption, here we propose a new procedure for collecting more significant responses from the judges, by avoiding both expensive workload, such as ordering a long sequence of pairs of terms, and tricky/noisy tasks, such as selecting a numeric level to quantify the semantic relatedness among two terms.","refs":[]},{"text":"Our proposal is to ask judges to select the concept (from a set of proposed concepts) which is most related to a given concept, where each concept is associated to a specific knowledge base (in our current work concepts are identified by Wikipedia pages). By associating each term to a concept of a knowledge base we can overcome the limitation of having datasets constituted by only terms. This approach allows to obtain two advantages: (i) the judges can take into account a unique specific meaning of the concepts when they produce their responses and (ii) the evaluated SR method can exploit the Wikipedia page associated to the concept for computing the semantic relatedness.","refs":[]},{"text":"More technically, we defined the questions for the judges as triples T = (t 1 , . . . , t m ), where the triple t i = (target i , c i1 , c i2 ) is constituted by a target concept and two other concepts c i1 , c i2 . For each triple t i , the judges have to identify which one among c i1 and c i2 is (in their views) more related to target i . For example, given the triple t=(Musician, Watch, Trumpet ), the evaluator can select Watch or Trumpet as more related to Musician. The reader can notice that the proposed procedure does not depend on a specific scale for collecting the feedback and this also simplifies the work of the judges who have to select only the most related concept. By selecting the concept semantically more related to the target concept the judge orders the three concepts according to the relatedness to the target. By following the previous example, if a judge chooses Trumpet then he implicitly defines the ordered list of concepts (Musician, Trumpet, Watch) since Trumpet has been considered as more related to Musician than Watch. We then take into account the way the judges order the concepts in each triple for evaluating the precision of a SR method. In particular, the SR method can order the concepts in the triple t i = (target i , c i1 , c i2 ) by computing the semantic relatedness between the target concept and the two concepts c i1 and c i2 and, consequently, it can produce a rank. In this way we compute the precision of the SR method according to the percentage of cases in which the SR method orders the concepts of the triples as the humans did.","refs":[]},{"text":"However, we also believe that there are various cases where humans cannot provide a response: the judge may be not familiar with a concept or even a topic or two concepts may be (more or less) equally semantically related to the target concept. In order to manage these situations, the judges are allowed to skip the evaluation of a triple, since we are keen to identify the responses for which the judges are sufficiently confident. By taking into account the number of judges who skipped a triple, we can measure a degree of trustworthiness of the overall feedback acquired for a specific single triple. More specifically, for each triple we computed an Indecision Score as the ratio between the number of judges who skipped the triple and the total number of judges. By taking into account a maximum threshold on the Indecision Score, we then remove the triples for which there is a certain percentage of judges who did not provide a response. We also filter out the triples with a low agreement among judges, by following the idea that a low agreement can be the result of different evaluation perspectives. To this aim we computed, for each triple t i , an Agreement Score as the maximum between (i) the ratio between the number of judges who selected the concept c i1 and the total number of judges and (ii) the ratio between the number of judges who selected the concept c i2 and the total number of judges. By requiring an Agreement Score higher than a certain threshold, we can remove ambiguities which may be introduced by different communities with different perspectives.","refs":[]},{"text":"We identify for each triple a 'correct' order of the concepts by taking into account the order defined by the majority of the judges. For example, supposing that the concept Trumpet, in the triple t=(Musician, Watch, Trumpet ), is more frequently selected than the concept Watch, then the order (Musician, Trumpet, Watch) is taken as the correct ranking. This 'correct ranking' is compared to the order computed by the evaluated SR method. In this way we define the precision of the evaluated SR method as the percentage of the correctly ordered triples by the SR method.","refs":[]},{"text":"Obviously, the approach used to build the triples has a significant impact on the results. As we said in Section 3, one of the main drawbacks of the datasets described in the literature depends on the number of domains and of different semantic relations included in the dataset. In order to face this issue, we have defined a specific set of templates for the triples, such as ( T ARGET , Emotion 1 , Emotion 2 ) and ( T ARGET , W ork 1 , W ork 2 ). Then, we create some triples by creating instantiating each template. For example, from the template ( T ARGET , Emotion 1 , Emotion 2 ), we can build the triple (Love, Graditude, Jelausy), the triple (Clown, Humor, Fear ) and so on. We also include other triples by picking concepts from systems such as Delicious and Open Directory. In particular, tags, categories, and other terms are extracted from these systems in order to create new triples. By using stacks of Delicious and categories in Open Directory we also select concepts (that must be concepts of Wikipedia) belonging to different domains. In this way we face (at least partially) the problem of covering semantic relations in different domains. In our first experiments we collected the feedback of 10 judges and each of them evaluated 420 triples in a month. Since the Agreement Score measures the agreement among the judges only on a single triple, we evaluated the overall agreement among the judges by by means of the Fleiss'kappa [7]. The Fleiss'kappa allows us to measure the agreement of the judges over the entire set of triples and, according to this analysis, we have a significant agreement also over the entire set of triples (kappa=0.783). Then we filtered the triples by throwing out the triples with an Agreement Score lower then 0.7 (i.e. we require that at least 7 of the 10 judges provided the same response) and with an Indecision Score higher then 0.2 (i.e. we require that at maximum 2 judges skipped the question). As expected, after this filtering step, we have that the agreement among the judges increases (kappa=0.849). However, it is interesting to observe that our filtering interventions removed only 27 triples from the initial set of 420 triples. Two examples of these triples are (Mammal, Dolphin, Lion) and (Lifeguard, Holiday, Work ). These two triples show the usefulness of the filtering step since we observed that many judges skipped the triple (Mammal, Dolphin, Lion) since Dolphin and Lion are both Mammals. The Indecision Score is used to discard this triple because, in this case, people could not find semantic relations for identifying which one of the two concepts is more related to the target concept. Similarly, if two concepts are completely unrelated to a given target concept, then judges cannot find semantic relations for answering. The Indecision Score allows us to remove these triples avoiding in this way potential ambiguities. In the case of the triple (Mammal, Dolphin, Lion), a part of the judges considered Lifeguard as someone you can meet during Holiday whereas another part of the judges considered Lifeguard as a Work. In this case, there is a low agreement due to the subjective way of perceiving the semantic relatedness. The Agreement Score allows us to remove such triples, enhancing in this way the significance of the dataset.","refs":[{"start":1451,"end":1454,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b6"}]}]},{"title":"Ongoing Evaluation and Future Steps","paragraphs":[{"text":"At the moment we are comparing new SR methods (that we specifically designed in order to compute the semantic relatedness between the Wikipedia concepts) with other state of the art mechanisms.","refs":[]},{"text":"In particular we defined new SR methods by extending some approaches proposed [13] where: (i) each Wikipedia concept is represented by its incoming pages (i.e. the pages with a link to the concept) and outcoming pages (i.e. the pages linked by the concept) and (ii) the semantic relatedness among two pages is computed by comparing their corresponding representations (larger is the number of shared incoming/outcoming links, higher is the similarity among the concepts).

Given such representation of concepts, the CIN metric computes the semantic relatedness between two concepts as the cosine similarity between the two corresponding vectors. In this way, the metric computes the semantic relatedness among two concepts according to the shared incoming pages.

Due to the growing interest of researchers in areas like Digital Libraries, Semantic Web, Information Retrieval, and NLP, various approaches have been proposed for automatically computing the semantic relatedness.
