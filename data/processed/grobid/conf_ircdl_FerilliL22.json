However, the objectives and constraints of recommendation in e-commerce are very different, and less complex, than in Digital Libraries. Usually recall (i.e., retrieving all potentially interesting items, at the cost of possibly including irrelevant ones) is preferred over precision (retrieving only interesting items, at the cost of possibly missing some of them). An explanation of the recommendation is typically not required, because the user may just watch at the suggestions and choose which of them, if any, to purchase. Last but not least, there are many fewer and simpler facets to consider for the recommendation. In contrast, for professional uses, such as digital library content recommendation, proposing a few but highly relevant items is needed. The features of the user and of the items to be taken into account are much larger and less well-defined and tightly coupled with the 'syntactic' content of the items. Explaining the suggestions is fundamental, both for the user and for the librarian, to make sure that the recommendation is properly understood by them.","refs":[]},{"text":"The latter issue is especially critical. It falls in the realm of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence, or XAI, a new branch of research focusing on the need to explain the decisions of AI systems to their users.

These must involve human-level reasoning so that the users may decide whether or not to use them, and why.","refs":[]},{"text":"A branch of AI aimed at reproducing human reasoning is Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, based on (typically First-Order) Logics representations and techniques. This setting usually requires a Logic to provide the formalism for representing knowledge about the given domain, a Calculus to provide inference mechanisms that produce new knowledge starting from the available one, and an Ontology to define the kind of entities that can be handled by the system along with their properties and relationships. In turn, the calculus may adopt a multistrategy setting, in which different kinds of inference cooperate in order to boost the inferential power of the system and tackle different needs and issues of the application domain. E.g., deduction produces new knowledge that was implicit in the available one, abduction hypothesizes sensible knowledge that was missing in the available one, argumentation resolves conflicting knowledge, etc. Thanks to its flexibility, this setting may also support the need for dealing with many more, and more 'conceptual', facets and features in digital library items recommendation.","refs":[]},{"text":"This paper proposes a logic-based approach to recommendation of items in a digital library. It involves an ontology that acts as a schema for the description of items and users to be represented in the knowledge base, a formalism borrowed by Logic Programming, and an inference strategy based on associative reasoning. A very initial prototype was implemented, and applied to the application domain of e-Learning, where the aim is recommending learning objects (the library items) to learners (the users), possibly after evaluation of a teacher (the librarian).

E-learning aims at using ICT to improve quality and fruition of education. By leveraging multimedia content and interactivity, it can improve engagement and comprehension by the learner. The on-line version of this setting has boosted the opportunities and widened the scope over traditional education, especially concerning access to contents independent of time and place. Elearning courses are based on Learning Objects (LOs for short), each concerning a limited and welldefined portion of their contents, and serving specific learning goals. They are delivered by software platforms called Learning Management Systems (or LMSs for short), that usually provide additional features, such as user statistics (used contents, time of use, etc.), social functions, etc. One of the earliest modern visions for using computers to enhance human learning was articulated in the 1960s by Engelbart, who developed a conceptual model for augmented intelligence [8,9] and introduced many elements of collaborative computing (including networks, shared workspaces, hypermedia, and video conferencing) that are nowadays standard. Applying this vision specifically to the individual learning process, Kay anticipated personal and mobile computing devices that dominate today's education [10]. However, whilst today lots of open educational resources such as MERLOT [12] and MIT's Open Courseware [11] provide free curated content, and enquiries through location-aware search engines instantly offer course details in one's subject area, their vision has not yet been realized. To fill this gap, a platform called KEPLAIR was proposed in [1].","refs":[{"start":1081,"end":1084,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b7"},{"start":1084,"end":1086,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b8"},{"start":1403,"end":1407,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b9"},{"start":1481,"end":1485,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b11"},{"start":1512,"end":1516,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b10"},{"start":1753,"end":1756,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b0"}]},{"text":"One of the key functions to make learning processes more learner-centered is the recommendation of learning materials and activities. The field of recommender systems is well-established in AI [16]. Two kinds of approaches proposed for this purpose are collaborative filtering (related to the user behavior) and content filtering (related to subject knowledge). The main focus in the literature has been on commercial applications, where the seller's interests have higher priority than the user's advantages. Recommendation in educational applications has followed their lead: e.g., 'learners who chose this course, also chose that course' or 'the average rating for this module was 4 out of 5'. However, neither of these approaches accounts for a learner's unique motivations, experience, learning path, or personal preferences. These limitations have been particularly obvious when considering 'lifelong learning', where formal and informal learning are intertwined and learners are responsible for directing their own learning [14]. To understand a learner's context, recommender systems would need to adopt a knowledge-based approach that takes into account additional information such as background knowledge, learner history and preferences [15]. Some works have specifically addressed the problem of document recommendation, but typically relying on standard or off-the-shelf recommendation approaches [22,24,25]. Some have investigated other tasks that may help recommendation, such as document classification [23] or explicit tagging [26] or cross-language settings [25]. Others have focused on specific contexts [21]. Conversely, we propose a new general recommendation strategy, based on a different and wider set of features and on a novel similarity computation; also, differently from standard approaches based only on distances, our technique also considers the paths in a knowledge base that connect the items to the user and can be useful to provide explanations of the recommendations.","refs":[{"start":193,"end":197,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b15"},{"start":1031,"end":1035,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b13"},{"start":1248,"end":1252,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b14"},{"start":1410,"end":1414,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b21"},{"start":1414,"end":1417,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b23"},{"start":1417,"end":1420,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b24"},{"start":1519,"end":1523,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b22"},{"start":1544,"end":1548,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b25"},{"start":1576,"end":1580,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b24"},{"start":1623,"end":1627,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b20"}]}]},{"title":"Keplair","paragraphs":[{"text":"KEPLAIR (Knowledge-based Environment for Personalized Learning using an Artificial Intelligence Recommender) [1,18] is a project aimed at developing an on-line e-learning platform that pervasively exploits AI solutions to support all the activities and stakeholders involved in an educational setting.

Considering a learner's stated goal, KEPLAIR will devise tailored subgoals to create learning paths, recommending suitable learning opportunities, resources and materials (the LOs) within these paths to make their educational experiences engaging and productive, tailored to their personal interests, abilities, and contexts.

The Learning Manager simulates human interactions via AI, acting as a tutor, counselor, and personalized assistant to build personalized learning paths for users, recommend appropriate LOs, and build tests to check the performance of the learners. The Social Manager handles interactions among users and communities of users in the educational context. All users' interactions with these modules are recorded in a Log repository, also used by both modules to drive their behavior. KEPLAIR may use Learning Objects (LOs) stored in its own repository or located elsewhere on the Internet. The 'external' LOs are identified and collected by a dedicated module, the Harvesting Manager, that also stores and continuously updates metadata describing the LOs in a LO Metadata repository. These metadata are used and updated by the Learning Manager during its activity, also based on the users' feedback on KEPLAIR's recommendations. The core layer pervasively relies on an underlying AI layer implementing an intelligent agent according to the architecture proposed in [7]. Among other functions, it builds and maintains the user's profiles and the LOs' metadata on which recommendation is based, and includes the reasoning facilities to match such profiles for recommendation purposes. The inference engine integrates several different kinds of reasoning to be applied on its Knowledge Base (KB), on the LO Metadata repository, and on the Log.

Instead, we should turn to techniques based on set operations on descriptors. Moreover, descriptors are not isolated pieces of information. They are often organized into taxonomies (e.g., 'Article' and 'Book' are both specific kinds of the 'Printable' type of 'Medium') and connected by several kinds of relationships (e.g., skills in 'Mathematics' may be needed to understand a book on 'Boolean Algebra'). If these taxonomies and relationships are stored in the KB, we should leverage them in our matching degree computation, going beyond simple set operations on descriptors. Additional challenges come from the fact that different types of objects to be matched (e.g., users to library items), might be described by different types of attributes. So, techniques based on simple set operations, such as Jaccard's index1 [19,20], are insufficient, and we need more advanced ways of identifying and handling the sets of descriptors to be associated to users and library items. One proposal that can deal with taxonomic relationships was proposed in [17]. However, here we also want to take into account other kinds of relationships. 2  Inspired by Jaccard's index, we propose to compute a distance based on the following strategy: 1. in each set of descriptors, remove the descriptors that are above others in the descriptors' taxonomy; 2. consider their set product, i.e., all pairs of descriptors (d',d\") where d' is taken from the former set and d'' from the latter set; 3. for each pair (d',d\") compute the number of hops in the path connecting d' to d'' in the descriptors' taxonomy; 4. compute the ratio of the sum of defined distances in the pairs over the total number of pairs. The distance between two descriptors equals 0 if the two descriptors are the same; it is undefined if there is no path in the taxonomy connecting the two descriptors. In the following we will denote the latter case by symbol '-'. Call x the distance value computed in the last step of the above procedure. The score function must be inversely proportional to the distance. We define it using the formula s(x) = 1/a x with a > 0. Since the distance can never be negative, the score can never be greater than 1. The higher the distance value, the lower the score computed by this function.

In the former, LOs are recommended based on the past activity of the learner. In the latter, LOs that are close to the subject of the current page are recommended, neglecting the user preferences.

Using the same sources of descriptors, the documents were tagged with any number of descriptors useful to describe their contents.

Note that there is a chance that some documents not selected by the users are nevertheless useful to them. Our experiment adopted a cautious setting in this respect, considering as useful only the documents that were a priori selected by the users, not asking the users to check the usefulness of the suggestions a posteriori. For user A, 14 candidate documents were retrieved by step 1 of our procedure, of which we considered only the 10 with highest matching degree for our statistics. User A is somehow an outlier, since for the other users no more than 6 candidates were found (6.2 on average, or 5.4 if considering only the 10 items actually recommended to user A). Recall that our candidate selection strongly depends on the contents of the KB, and thus some documents might not be considered as candidates just because they are beyond the 5-hop limit. The average number of hits on these recommendations is 3.6, corresponding to an average percentage of 72%. This is not bad, meaning that more than 2/3 of recommendations were able to guess the interests expressed a priori by the user. Also, the percentage of hits never falls below 50%, meaning that our technique seems to be effective also in each single case, not only on average. Only one recommendation was returned for user B, but it was correct. We have to consider that the users were required to choose 10 documents, but it may be that they were really interested only in the top items in their ranking, and that the bottom part of the ranking was filled in just to reach the required number of items. Checking in more detail the correspondence of ranking positions between the recommendations and the gold standard, the average distance is 2.79 positions, with a minimum of 1.67 and a maximum of 4. On a ranking of 10 items, this is also not bad. Of course, these results are not statistically significant.
