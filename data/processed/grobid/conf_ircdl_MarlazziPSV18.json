Two surrogates anywhere in the database are equal if and only if they denote the same real-world entity. 9 For each type T (irrespective of its role), a unary relation on ED, called an E-relation, is defined, which asserts the existence of an entity of type T. Besides, for each characteristic type C, an additional binary relation on ED × ED is defined, binding each entity of type C to the entity it describes; and for each associative type establishing a relationship among n other (not necessarily distinct) types, an n + 1 relation on ED × • • • × ED is defined, in which one attribute identifies the associative entity and the remaining n attributes refer to the other interrelated entities.","refs":[{"start":301,"end":302,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_0"}]},{"text":"Entities typically also have simple (immediate) properties that describe them; in particular, in most cases they (should) have simple properties identifying them, i.e., subsets of properties assuming a unique value for each distinct entity. Simple properties are modelled using property relations (P -relations), i.e., n-ary relations P (S : ED, A 1 : D 1 , . . . , A n : D n ), where S identifies (to the system) the entity being described, and each attribute A i is defined on a suitable domain D i (which constrains the admissible values for property A i ). If D i = ED for some i then P is called a designative relation.

One constraint that will be useful to keep in mind is that every occurrence of a surrogate anywhere in the database must appear in at least one E-relation. Another important constraint is that each characteristic entity is existent-dependent on the entity it refers to (which is not required for one-tomany relationships in general).

In 1979, the video was recorded on an analogue U-Matic cassette. It depicted the artist while watching a home movie he had made with his family a couple of years before (Fig. 2). The institution owning the video had many copies of the same artwork in several different (VHS and DVD) cartridges. Some time after the acquisition by our lab, we found out that, in 1982, the artist had produced a 'remake' of the video with the same content and title, but with different production technologies. Besides, further documental research revealed that the first version of Do You Remember this Movie? had been featured as part of a multi-media installation entitled I looked for. . . (da Alice 1977), which was presented during a collective exhibition in 1980 [7] (see Fig. 1). Eventually, we also found the film of the home movie which had been projected in both versions of Do You Remember this Movie?  We face, then, a set of complex relationships among: one 'original' artwork created in 1979; a different version with the same title dated 1982; a homemovie film (with no title) made between 1975 and 1976 by the same artist; and a multimedia installation with a temporal component constituted by four different videos, among which Do You Remember this Movie?, and a spatial component, including the room, a green bench and four photographs (see Fig. 1).

The inestricable relationship between abstract works and their concrete manifestations is captured by treating Work as a cover type having Manifestation instances as members. According to such point of view, a work is essentially just a less granular view of a set of manifestations. Similarly, Manifestation and Collection are also cover (in fact, partition) types with Item instances as members.","refs":[]},{"text":"The Variant/Expression type is modelled as an associative relation between works (possibly with additional constraints, such as the requirement that it is a strict partial order). Using an associative type circumvents the inherent semantic overlap between 'expressions/variants' and 'works', which would occur if Variant were treated as kernel. It also removes the transitive dependency (works have many variants or manifestations, and variants have many manifestations) implied by the FIAF proposal.","refs":[]},{"text":"To account for mixed media entities such as I Looked For. . . and Do You Remember This Movie?, we must recognise that the former is not a manifestation of the latter, nor a variant; instead, the latter is an essential constituent element of the former. Mixed media items are composed of A/V items and extra-filmic material (e.g., photographs, objects, spaces). Making such composition relationships explicit is essential for cataloguing, because reuse is common in video art and non-theatrical cinema-in fact, we argue that Composition is at least as important as Variant. Compositions may be specified at any level of granularity (items, manifestations, works), hence they must be modelled using three (not independent) associative types: ItemCompose, ManifCompose, WorkCompose. For instance, Do You Remember This Movie? is a component of I Looked For. . . at the work level; the 1978's version is a component of the (only) manifestation of I Looked For. . . ; but, as it happens, we do not know any relationship at the item level.","refs":[]},{"text":"Finally, for each defined entity type, an arbitrary number of properties and characteristics can be defined. 11 Many RM/T queries make no assumption on the number and structure of P -relations or on the size and depth of characteristic trees.
