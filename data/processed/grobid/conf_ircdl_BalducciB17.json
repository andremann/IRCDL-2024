The annotation tool is the first step to create an heterogeneous integrated system, which architecture is depicted in Fig. 1. The system core is the Digital Library which stores and organizes the dataset acquired from hospital equipment: it currently consists of 436 medical skin images in standard JPEG format with a high spatial resolution of 4000 × 2664 or 3000 × 4000 pixels. The software has been developed to enable the annotation of images by domain experts, like dermatologists, and it is described in the following subsection: it permits to easily draw strokes with different colors (8 choices) and pen sizes (4 choices), where each color denotes a specific semantic given by dermatologists (this aspect will be addressed in future works).","refs":[{"start":274,"end":275,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_0"}]},{"text":"The main goal of this tool is the retention of annotations in the form of a new enriched images also indexing each drawn stroke (in turn composed by points correspondent to image pixels).

An activation function is exploited to introduce non-linearity inside the architecture [20]. Finally, a loss function represents the cost associated to the achievement of a final goal, like correct classification, regression and so on. The main issue of CNN is the huge amount of data needed in the training phase: with an unbalanced or small dataset they are prone to both over fitting and under fitting phenomena; to avoid this, data augmentation is often performed so an annotation tool to easily acquire and produce high-quality annotated biomedical images could be really useful and important.
