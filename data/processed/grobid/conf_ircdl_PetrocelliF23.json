He also proposed a \"centralization\" of cataloguing efforts. As a reformer, Dewey also initiated those educational processes that he considered fundamental to designing the emerging profession of the librarian, suggesting, among other things, that the ideal candidates were the women who, by their nature, paid more attention to detail and had a strong \"moral sense\". Dewey also argued that they had the benefit of being paid only half as much as their male counterparts and could be counted on for their dedication to their work. These were probably his motivations for strongly opposing the board of trustees of Columbia College in 1887, who did not welcome women in the School of Library Science, by starting classes in off-campus premises with twenty students, seventeen of them women. [1:85-93] At the turn of the 20th century, US government agencies had started a process of promoting public libraries, especially in rural areas of the country. By attracting the same workforce as the school system, which was predominantly female, women had the opportunity to choose an activity related to libraries: female students were instilled with a fervent desire to become 'book missionaries' with the aim of spreading the culture of reading. 2 [2:2].","refs":[{"start":1090,"end":1099,"marker":"bibr","target":null}]},{"text":"However, this philosophy began to lose strength when, in the 1920s and 1930s, the utilitarian aspect of book distribution took hold, geared mainly towards the consumer who had to be guided in his choices by library managers.

This division was further exacerbated during the period in which the information technology changed the face of libraries: the program of \"automation\", which had been initiated in the 1960s, taking advantage of the widespread techniques of punch cards and microphotography 3 , had begun to delineate what would be the \"library of the future\", while leaving unchanged the \"gender dynamics of the present\".","refs":[{"start":690,"end":691,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_1"}]}]},{"title":"From cards to ASCII characters: sharing between librarian and user","paragraphs":[{"text":"From April 21 to October 21 1962, the American Library Association (ALA), for the first time, secured a spot at the World's Fair in Seattle.

The rise of computer science threatened to divide librarianship and overwhelm what was its humanistic core: «being traditionally humanistic, librarians doubt their capacity even to utilize anything that is scientifically derived.» [6:742] The classical ideals that saw the \"library\" as a place to cherish freedom of speech, as a safe haven of information and a repository of memory, that is, places dedicated to serving the needs of the community, pushed to designate only women to be guardians of morality and to be promoters of reading, inevitably shifting the male contribution to projects in which library science and economics were not only predominant, but also crucial to continued change.","refs":[{"start":615,"end":622,"marker":"bibr","target":null}]},{"text":"As dean of the School of Library Science at Western Reserve University, Shera strongly supported the establishment of the Center for Documentation and Communication Research to promote information systems as a means of enabling librarians to operate at a higher level of information storage and retrieval.

According to Margaret Kaltenbach, Shera's collaborator, the Center was identified more as a school of computer science than anything else, and this represented its main limitation. [7:157] From this point on, Shera no longer indicated what was the best path to follow, distancing himself from both technology and the fear of its dominance and never taking a clear position: «The library is not a machine shop in which knowledge is fabricated by mechanical devices […] we regret the indifference, and even hostility, of many librarians to the advantages the new electronic devices, which are as yet only in their infancy, can give to improving the efficiency of man's access to recorded knowledge.» [8] Librarians could learn from \"technologists\" and leave the Stone Age behind.","refs":[{"start":743,"end":750,"marker":"bibr","target":null},{"start":1260,"end":1263,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b7"}]},{"text":"Along with mathematicians, systems designers, hardware manufacturers, operations researchers, and computer programmers, they were therefore concerned with understanding «how interwoven are their interests and how overlapping their responsibilities» in libraries.

Among these, we should undoubtedly mention the project presented by a small group of representatives of the academic libraries of Ohio, whose leaders were Ralph Parker, director of the University of Missouri Library and Fred Kilgour, librarian of the Yale Medical Library. Their proposal was to use large, cumbersome mainframe computers 5 to initiate what is known as cooperative, computerized, networked cataloging of library resources. To that end, in 1967, Parker and Kilgour had founded the Ohio College Library Center (OCLC), a committee that was initially joined by 54 Ohio college libraries and that only fifty years later would include more than 16,000 members in 120 different countries, serving libraries of all types with more than 40 million research requests each day.

Starting in the seventies, in fact, the availability of new computer technologies had caused a strong acceleration towards the use of computers and various methods of photoreproduction. The multiplication of libraries, together with the proliferation of numerous forms and dynamics of compiling electronic catalogs, had also led to the urgent need to coordinate these activities: international study committees such as UNESCO, the International Federation of Documentation (FID) and the International Federation of Librarians' Associations (IFLA-FIAB), were urged to unify bibliographic rules and systems in order to produce general cataloguing standards that would apply internationally.

Why these mutations? The only reference object of the library, the book, with the passage of time had turned into a general entity of \"information\" that did not always coincide with the \"book\" object and that was also identified with articles extracted from magazines, images, music CDs, videos, multimedia and hypermedia of various kinds. We were moving away from content, giving space, as Ruth Hafter points out, mostly to issues of data organization: «rules and procedures change» over time in a myriad of ways because they may need to be adapted to modern terminology, the latest scientific thinking, or innovative research practices; at the same time, users may evolve in their needs and demands; and, of course, the very technology for entering, storing, and accessing catalog data may change, affecting labor costs and delivery times for the required material [15:11-12].","refs":[{"start":477,"end":481,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b13"},{"start":1350,"end":1360,"marker":"bibr","target":null}]}]},{"title":"Digital Libraries","paragraphs":[{"text":"One has to go as far as 1992 to have a rigorous definition of a Digital Library.

Of course, this must be compliant to existing DL cataloging and description standards: to this aim, our ontology includes, and is aligned to, several standard ontologies and metadata schemas, such as the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) 6 , the IFLA Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) report [22], the Open Archives Initiative Object Reuse and Exchange (OAI-ORE) 7 , and OpenAIRE [23].

The Physical section enables a description of the physical library/archive items, not just of their content. The Content section allows to tag the documents as a whole, or specific sections thereof, with keywords and concepts, to extract citations and excerpts, and to describe the specific items (Persons, Places, Events, Artifacts, other Documents, etc.) mentioned therein. Concepts, in particular, are represented as instances within the KG, so that they can be linked to other instances of any class in the KB in order to describe them. Several standard taxonomies can be stored, aligned and merged, also adding user-defined and/or domain-specific items. The current KB includes WordNet [28], the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) system [21] and a few taxonomies specifically focused on Computer Science and Engineering. Especially relevant (and fundamental to 'open' the records) is the Context (in the form of additional Persons, Places, Events, Artifacts, other Documents, etc.), that allows to interconnect the documents and their content 8 . Finally, the Lifecycle section allows to track the documents along time, connecting them to their uses and users. This enables the description of the processes underlying the items' exploitation, and the personalization of such exploitation (by describing user profiles and connecting their features to those of the items). In designing this part of the ontology, the user's point of view and the behavior that librarians pursue in their research are taken into account, in order to improve the KB in a targeted way. In fact, previous works in this and other fields [24,25] show the advantages of usercentered approaches for constructing KGs of information systems. Some of the main classes currently included in our ontology are: Person, Organization, Place, Event, Artifact, Device, Document, Collection, Citation, IntellectualWork, ProcessComponent, User, PointOfInterest, Category, Language, Text, TimeSpecification. Many relationships are provided to connect the documents and their content to instances of these classes, and the instances of these classes to each other, providing the added value that we envisage in our holistic approach. Every instance of a class or a relationship is actually a record, described by a suitable set of attributes.","refs":[{"start":775,"end":779,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b27"},{"start":827,"end":831,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b20"},{"start":1133,"end":1134,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_6"},{"start":1703,"end":1707,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b23"},{"start":1707,"end":1710,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b24"}]},{"text":"In addition to the expanded data model, we also propose to change the technological approach to KG representation. The solutions proposed by standard research in KR for representing and storing knowledge have parted from the mainstream solutions for DBs. Research in KR resulted in an established representation standard for formal ontologies (the Ontology Web Language, or OWL 9 ) and associated data storage technology, called triplestores. Triplestores are based on the RDF graph model, consisting of sets of triples <Subject, Predicate, Object> where the three components are atomic (Uniform Resource Identifiers -URIs -or literal values). However, these attempts have failed to meet wide acceptance in industrial applications. On the other hand, significant success among big industrial players has been obtained by a new graph-based NoSQL DB technology, of which Neo4j is the most outstanding representative. It adopts the Labeled Property Graphs (LPG) model, that allows to associate sets of attribute-value pairs and labels to nodes and arcs. Nodes represent entity instances, arcs represent binary relationships on them, the attribute-value pairs represent properties, and the labels usually represent the type of entity or relationship. The LPG model is more expressive than, but incompatible with, the RDF one. Neo4j is schema-less, for which reason we propose to superimpose an ontology that acts as a schema.","refs":[{"start":378,"end":379,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_7"}]},{"text":"We believe that DL data representation and management must still rely on DB technology, in order to ensure optimization and efficiency in data storage and handling. So, we propose a cooperation between DB technologies and the KR setting, that may boost the effectiveness of DL data management so as to support the needs of different kinds of users, providing them new possibilities for data exploitation and opening new opportunities to carry out their activities [18]. In our proposal, Formal Ontologies play the role of data schemas10 for the instances stored in LPG-based DBs. Differently from most works in the literature, that just tried to superimpose OWL to LPGs, losing the expressive power of the latter, we propose to develop a specific ontological formalism for LPGs, so as to take full advantage of their expressiveness.","refs":[{"start":464,"end":468,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b17"},{"start":534,"end":536,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_8"}]},{"text":"Finally, we also propose a framework that implements our vision, called GraphBRAIN [19], and associated tools for schema and instance handling [20]. In GraphBRAIN, the ontologies and the instances are kept separate from each other (while in OWL/RDF solutions the schema is represented within the graph). This allows to superimpose different ontologies as schemas on the same graph, representing different views on the same data. A GraphBRAIN API acts as a wrapper for the DB to make it available to external applications. All accesses to the DB and operations on its content must pass through the API methods, that given a DB instance and a schema/ontology provides access to the DB so as to ensure compliance with the data schema. To ensure interoperability with standard KR solutions, GraphBRAIN provides import/export functionality from/to OWL for ontologies and/or individuals.","refs":[{"start":83,"end":87,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b18"},{"start":143,"end":147,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b19"}]},{"text":"It is worth mentioning that the KB approach to library knowledge representation also enables automated reasoning on the data.

After all, in cataloguing, as Hafter already pointed out in 1986, \"rules and procedures change\" over time and adapt to innovative research practices that give the catalogue a status that can change, just as the technology itself for entering, storing and accessing catalogue data changes [15:11-12].","refs":[{"start":683,"end":693,"marker":"bibr","target":null}]},{"text":"So far technology has mostly been used to transpose the standard library practices, and little has been done to fully exploit the new opportunities it introduced.
