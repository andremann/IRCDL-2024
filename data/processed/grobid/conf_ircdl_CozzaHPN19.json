Some of the most popular e-commerce websites let users search for products by simply issuing a keyword search. Then, a number of filters can be activated to constraint the search results. Such filters are usually defined over a number of attributes of the products, like the vendor, the brand, the size, and the price range. The filters allow to narrow the results list, and, together with characteristics of the users, such as their behavior, the location they search from, and the data on their profiles, allow to obtain a personalised set of items as the outcome of the search.","refs":[{"start":189,"end":193,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b24"},{"start":193,"end":196,"marker":"bibr","target":null}]},{"text":"The dark side of personalization relies however in the fact that filters can be activated, or changed, without the user's awareness and consent.

Consequences of lack of transparency and bias are, e.g., to hide potentially interesting products [22], give relevance to some news with respect to others [7], expose different prices for the same product, depending, e.g., on the characteristics of the user making the search [18], and even reveal users' private information [4].

In personalization measurement studies, a very relevant aspect, often underestimated, is the quality of the user profiles [23]. This study simulates real user profiles surfing Google Shopping US from different geographic locations. The creation of a new profile corresponds to launch a new isolated web browser client instance and open the Google Shopping US web page. Also, instead of providing artificial ad hoc user profiles, the experiments consider the IP addresses of the users. Indeed, it has been shown that, in some countries (e.g., in US), the manual insertion of the user location (in the form, e.g., of a postal code) in the user profile do unfairly affects the price results [30]. Furthermore, locations and postal codes can be easily altered during the profile registration phase [17].","refs":[{"start":137,"end":141,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b22"},{"start":703,"end":707,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b28"},{"start":809,"end":813,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b16"}]},{"text":"Emulating Users.

Differently from previous work in the area, here geographical locations are combined with one of the indicators of the economic performance of the locations, i.e., the Gross Domestic Product. As locations, this work considered cities in three different countries. The analyses aimed at investigating order and averages of prices shown to users. Regarding the order, the considered metric is the difference between the list of price results, as obtained by considering the results of our queries, and an ideal list of results, defined as an ordered list, where the products with the highest prices are first shown to the user. The analysis also considers, at a glance, how the average prices for different categories of products change, location by location. While able to testify the existence of price steering and quantifying its level, country per country, the results of the investigations lead also to unexpected results: even if the experiments on the order of prices highlight the specific country that mostly adheres to the ideal list of results (from the most to the least expensive one), often the average price of the shown results for that specific country is lower than that for the other two countries under investigation. The significance of the obtained results were evaluated by running permutation tests. While satisfactory for certain product categories, they not always succeeded in proving the statistical significance of the experiments. This calls for further investigations. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work that automatically analyses price steering with respect to GDP values. This introduces a novel, and alternative, methodology, to automatically collect price results exploiting their users' searches on e-commerce search engines. Finally, this work relies on a relatively small set of synthetic accounts and investigated locations. As future work, a natural follow up is to run a wider experimental campaign, considering different e-commerce platforms, more accounts and more locations (like, e.g., different areas in the same city, and different cities in the same country). As a plus, the illustrated methodology can be easily applied on a large scale too.","refs":[]}]}],"tables":{"tab_0":{"heading":"Table 1 .","description":"An excerpt of average NDCG per location, per sample product","rows":[["Product","NDCG@3","","NDCG@10"],["","Philippines India US","Philippines India US"],["Boot","0.826","0.85 0.18 0.746","0.755 0.252"],["Ceiling fan","0.524","0.527 0.245 0.736","0.692 0.475"],["Desktop","0.114","0.062 0.813 0.219","0.178 0.783"],["Dress","0.628","0.905 0.282 0.678","0.778 0.371"],["Helmet","0.592","0.786 0.639 0.639","0.812 0.654"],["LightScribe","0.138","0.387 0.174 0.27","0.588 0.432"],["Moisturizer","0.775","0.524 0.48 0.755","0.549 0.523"],["MP3 player","0.164","0.111 0.165 0.305","0.289 0.312"],["Pant","0.228","0.271 0.291 0.305","0.446 0.405"],["Pocket video camera 0.019","0.079 0.574 0.91","0.229 0.28"],["Portable CD player 0.129","0.097 0.163 0.342","0.352 0.475"],["Portable DVD player 0.338","0.318 0.859 0.402","0.426 0.87"],["Television","0.222","0.282 0.542 0.422","0.461 0.592"],["Universal remote","0.554","0.161 0.597 0.506","0.194 0596"],["Wheel","0.177","0.202 0.715 0.281","0.311 0.793"]]},"tab_1":{"heading":"Table 2 .","description":"Average NDCG@10 per location, per sample product category","rows":[["Category","Philippines India US","Category","Philippines India US"],["Apparel","0.389","0.4 0.31 Electronic devices 0.195","0.202 0.4"],["Body products 0.48","0.455 0.446 All","0.397","0.406 0.42"]]},"tab_2":{"heading":"Table 3 .","description":"Average prices per country and sample products considering the top 10 results","rows":[["Product","Average prices (US $)","Average prices (US $)"],["","Philippines India US Product","Philippines India US"],["Boot","136","136","122 Pant","36","51","73"],["Ceiling fan 360","340","211 Pocket video camera 151","117","73"],["Desktop","717","887","368 Portable CD player","50","52","72"],["Dress","110","100","86 Portable DVD player 66","57","64"],["Helmet","299","378","315 Television","455","519","625"],["LightScribe 67","65","128 Universal remote","41","43","95"],["Moisturizer 22","18","14 Wheel","262","238","178"]]},"tab_3":{"heading":"Table 4 .","description":"Average prices and coefficient of variation per country and category considering the top 10 results","rows":[["Category","Average prices (US $) Coefficient of variation"],["","Philippines India US Philippines India US"],["Apparel","62","67","59 1.03","1.08 0.84"],["Body products","62","67","59 1.03","1.08 0.84"],["Electronic devices 281","289 149 1.10","1.08 0.93"],["All","175","173 224 1.4","1.4","5.4"]]},"tab_4":{"heading":"Table 5 .","description":"p-values obtained from permutation tests over NDCG values.","rows":[["Location","Category","p-value Category","p-value"],["Philippines vs US","All","0.050 Electronic devices 0.013"],["India vs US","All","0.050 Electronic devices 0.056"],["Philippines vs India All","0.89","Electronic devices 0.90"],["Philippines vs US","Accessories 0.669","For house","0.096"],["India vs US","Accessories 0.525","For house","0.193"],["Philippines vs India Accessories 0.819","For house","0.740"],["Philippines vs US","Apparel","0.136 Others","0.449"],["India vs US","Apparel","0.056 Others","0.351"],["Philippines vs India Apparel","0.629","Others","0.601"],["Philippines vs US","Body care 0.394",""],["India vs US","Body care 0.609",""],["Philippines vs India Body care 0.711",""]]}},"abstract":{"title":"Abstract","paragraphs":[{"text":"The most popular e-commerce search engines allow the user to run a keyword search, to find relevant results and to narrow down the results by mean of filters.
