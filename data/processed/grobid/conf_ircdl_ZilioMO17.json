Film-induced tourism has been defined by Sue Beeton as \"visitation to sites where movies and TV programmes have been filmed as well as to tour to production studios, including film-related theme parks\" [2]. It may be very helpful for destination management and destination marketing: it attracts new visitors and also tourists who have already seen the area for a different reason; it is largely independent of seasonal trends; it might convey tourists from overcrowded sites to new and less explored ones; and it can be suitable for a substantial re-branding of a certain area. A number of film-induced tourism related initiatives has been already undertaken at the international level by public and private bodies, which developed movie maps and movie tours or exploited the success of a particular movie as a tool for destination branding [5].","refs":[{"start":317,"end":320,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b1"},{"start":957,"end":960,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b4"}]},{"text":"Visit Britain, the tourism office of the UK, was one of the first agencies to use movies for attracting tourists: since the nineties it designed movie tours and developed tools such as movie maps, that is maps representing locations of movies and TV series.

Although the focus was on locations in Padua and its Province, the in-depth description even for a relatively small geographical area showed to be a time-consuming task. One critical aspect was that a restricted number of users -e.g. scholars in film studies -were involved in providing all the information, from film analysis to location identification. Yet, only part of this information required the competences of trained experts while most of the time was spent in the less specialized task of annotating multimedia items with geographical information.

Amazon Mechanical Turk1 and Crowd-Flower2 are well-known crowdsourcing platforms, which have been exploited also for multimedia research.
