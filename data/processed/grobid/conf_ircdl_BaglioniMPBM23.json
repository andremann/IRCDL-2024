There are also 16 wrong duplicate sets (9 because of FDup being wrong, 7 because of incorrect claims in the registries), and 74 not working URLs. Furthermore, different duplicate sets can still refer to the same repository: de-duplication and registry claims do not have a common profile on whose basis our methodology can extend the duplicate set. Although we experimentally verified the presence of four of them, we cannot provide their exact number.","refs":[]}]},{"title":"Discussion","paragraphs":[{"text":"On the one hand, the registry claims are a good starting point to identify multiple registrations of the same repository, but they are far from complete, and, most importantly, they are sometimes proved to be inaccurate.

Moreover, in some cases, time and effort do not suffice, as domain expert knowledge is required to determine whether two profiles can be considered the same (e.g., [rd:r3d100010553] and [fs:1956] whose website URLs resolve to very different pages). Furthermore, some choices would also remain discretionary, for example, in the case of two repositories being registered with the same name and with URLs resolving, in one case to a list of collections or subsets of a repository, and in the other to one of these subsets. Unfortunately, there is no clear way to address such a conundrum without domain expert knowledge.","refs":[]},{"text":"In conclusion, this study and the results presented here outline a first-of-its-kind wake-up call to raise awareness about the inherent ambiguity residing in scholarly repository registries. While information scattering, consistency and duplication are not new in data quality literature, siloed, out-of-sync, scholarly repository registries can have a detrimental impact on the global scientific track record.","refs":[]},{"text":"Firstly and foremost, inconsistency and incompleteness of a registry content can negatively affect its image and directly hamper its uptake and reliability in the eyes of the research community(ies) of reference.","refs":[]},{"text":"Moreover, scholarly registries' downstream users, such as researchers, scholarly service providers, and Open Science infrastructures listing and aggregating their content, are exposed to potentially conflictual information, which has to be reconciled on an arbitrary (possibly manual) basis. The OpenAIRE infrastructure, for example, aggregates data sources (i.e., repositories) from a variety of registries, such as FAIRsharing, OpenDOAR, re3data, and CRIS Systems. When the same repository is ingested from multiple registries, OpenAIRE needs to reconcile the duplicates into one single record. One copy is elected as master (if possible) and is enriched with all the identifiers from the other copies. As it is not always possible to choose a master, multiple copies of the same data source can still appear in the OpenAIRE portal. The de-duplication of data sources within OpenAIRE mostly entails manual work, and the cross-references provided by the registries and the de-duplication have to be checked and enriched with other repositories that were not included to get duplicate sets as accurate as possible.","refs":[]},{"text":"Finally, as subsequent registrations yield multiple identifiers (e.g., a DOI) for the same repository, assessing metrics reflecting the usage, adoption rate, and impact of a repository across the academic community can be hindered if equivalence across different registrations cannot be precisely pinpointed.","refs":[]},{"text":"In our opinion, such problems can be solved mostly via an agreed-upon solution, paving the way towards the full support of interoperability across registries to enable a seamless exchange of the wealth of information contained therein.","refs":[]}]}],"tables":{"tab_0":{"heading":"Table 1","description":"Summary of the four registries","rows":[["Registry Dump date Dump method","Licence","# repos # claims"],["FAIRsharing Feb 2022","JSON (rest API) CC-BY-SA","1,853","787"],["re3data Feb 2022","OpenAIRE","CC-BY","2,793","475"],["OpenDOAR Feb 2022","OpenAIRE","CC-BY-NC-ND 5,811","N/A"],["ROAR Feb 2022","CSV (website)","CC-BY","5,444","3,279"]]}},"abstract":{"title":"Abstract","paragraphs":[{"text":"The full exploitation of scholarly repositories is pivotal in modern Open Science, and scholarly repository registries are kingpins in enabling researchers and research infrastructures to list and search for suitable repositories. However, since multiple registries exist, repository managers are keen on registering multiple times the repositories they manage to maximise their traction and visibility across different research communities, disciplines, and applications. These multiple registrations ultimately lead to information fragmentation and redundancy on the one hand and, on the other, force registries' users to juggle multiple registries, profiles and identifiers describing the same repository. Such problems are known to registries, which claim equivalence between repository profiles whenever possible by cross-referencing their identifiers across different registries. However, as we will see, this \"claim set\" is far from complete and, therefore, many replicas slip under the radar, possibly creating problems downstream. In this work, we combine such claims to create duplicate sets and extend them with the results of an automated clustering algorithm run over repository metadata descriptions. Then we manually validate our results to produce an \"as accurate as possible\" de-duplicated dataset of scholarly repositories.","refs":[]}]}}
