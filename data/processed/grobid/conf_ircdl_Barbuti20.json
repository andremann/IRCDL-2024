Starting from this assumption, we must rethink digitization, digitalization and digital transformation as recording and representing the processes of contemporary life cycles, no longer as simple tools to improve access to reality. So, we must define clear and homogeneous criteria to validate and certify what among contemporary digital magma we can identify as Digital Cultural Heritage (DCH). This paper outlines a proposal in such way starting from the extension of the R: Reusable requirement of FAIR Principles to R 5 adding the requirements: Readable, Relevant, Reliable and Resilient. These requirements should lead the design and creation of descriptive metadata in open format for indexing and managing digital cultural resources. The Terra delle Gravine between sharing economy and experiential tourism project was a case study for testing this proposal. Three digital libraries of the municipal libraries of Massafra, Mottola and Grottaglie were designed and implemented by creating an open data schema for indexing and describing the digital resources.","refs":[]}]}}
