The increasing use of technologies oriented to the Semantic Web(SemWeb) 1 forces digital library managers to rethink the way of providing information about managed resources. The SemWeb provides a common framework which allows to share data and to re-use it across applications, enterprises, and community boundaries. Over the classic \"Web of documents\", the SemWeb is a technology stack 2 enabling to develop systems supporting trusted interactions over the network, and allowing computers to do more useful work. In respect to the \"layer cake\", the status of technologies, in the digital library management, is characterized by the wide use of the Extensible Markup Language (XML) technologies. By using semantics community-based, the digital library systems are able to exchange documents in a coherent way. At present, the Resource Description Framework(RDF) data model has started to be experimented in library communities, under the motivation of the Linked Data Initiaves(LD) and it has been especially used over the web for open values (or controlled) vocabularies [12]. In addition, different ontologies related to library domain have been developed by designated communities 3,4,5 . The semantic model, presented in this paper, aims to support the SemWeb technologies implementation, over an existing digital library management system. Derived from a community-shared metadata profile, the semantic model encompasses conceptual descriptions expressing the knowledge base of the digital library descriptive metadata. The model is the conceptual guidance for considering the best solution to be adopted, among a variety of approaches for the implementation of SemWeb technologies for descriptive metadata.","refs":[{"start":179,"end":180,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b2"},{"start":1292,"end":1294,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b4"},{"start":1294,"end":1296,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b5"},{"start":1296,"end":1297,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b6"}]}]},{"title":"Background and Motivation","paragraphs":[{"text":"The technologies, composing the first layers of the SemWeb stack, are here summarized in order to show their main characteristics and informational objectives. The XML technologies 6 have been conceived for managing data, structured as a hierarchical tree. XML is widely used for application contexts where is necessary to exchange data with a structure semantically pre-defined. One of the most important historical advantage is, having provided text information with a \"well-formed\" structure, that is named with human-readable semantics, that are community-based. The upper layers of the SemWeb stack use the XML as official syntax. The Resource Description Framework(RDF) 7 , allows to build statements about web resources in the form of a subject-predicate-object expression. The statements can be interpreted by machines, that become capable to make connections between resources over the Web. The RDF schema(RDFS) 8 provides the framework to describe application-specific classes and properties and provides a data-modelling vocabulary for RDF data. The Web Ontology Language(OWL), currently at the second version 9 , is a standard for defining ontologies that are used to capture knowledge about some domain of interest. It provides classes, properties, individuals, and data values, stored as SemWeb documents. The OWL is a semantic markup language for publishing and sharing ontologies on the Web. OWL is developed as a vocabulary extension of RDF, and every OWL ontology is a valid RDF document. The OWL may be categorised into three species or sub-languages in the 1st version (OWL-Lite, OWL-DL, OWLFull), and three profiles in the 2nd version. The OWL-EL, OWL-DL, OWL-RL, as profiles of the 2nd version, have been defined for shaping the ontology expressiveness and coherently supporting the computability degree. The implementation of the technologies, from the RDF up to OWL, over a legacy system, that uses XML as format for exchanging information, requires to state at least a point of reference for defining semantics, in order to model the implementation of SemWeb technologies: RDF as data model, RDFS as description of RDF data, OWL as more-formal language to be used by reasoning systems. The semantic model, presented in this paper, is indeed the reference model for implementing semantic web technologies in the domain of the management of resources, that belong to a digital library. In particular, it makes transparent main concepts associated with the resources' content description, used by the digital library system. The model can be used as semantic foundation for different approaches that can be undertaken in implementing SemWeb technologies, over the existing digital library system.

The MODS schema has defined the use of same attributes for different XML elements 29 , and indeed the figure highlights the wide re-use of the same attributes (i.e. @displayLabel, @type...) in different conceptual contexts. This graphical evidence warns that, in this case, the semantic disambiguation of the information is contained in the value of the attribute, and not in the XML schema data definition. Similarly, the homonymy of sub-elements (i.e. @languageTerm, @extent), need to be solved by inheriting the conceptual name of the higher level semantic elements. Mostly the same inheritance application coherently works for all sub-elements that cannot have sufficient semantic specification, like in the role case.","refs":[]},{"text":"Another critical aspect to be highlighted by the semantic point of view, is the recursive functionality held by the relatedItem element, that requires the semantic disambiguation of the contained elements. The disambiguation can be managed by a semantic inheritance mechanism where a combination of relatedItem's attribute values and contained element's names can distinguish different concepts expressed by the recursive elements. The Fig. 1 also shows the reference to the controlled vocabularies, used by the SDL MODS profile, and exhibits the association to relevant concepts. The rounded rectangles containing an URI, and in close contact with some ovals (the concepts), specify that the concept's value is derived from the controlled vocabulary deferenced by URI.

For example, the production of RDF triples can mostly depend on technology environment factors, the RDF triples could come from a Relational Database mapping or managed directly by a triple store system. Similarly, the conceptual modelling of an ontology, in order to be used by reasoning systems, cannot be expressed in OWL 2 because of the high complexity of computation, but it needs to be profiled into one of the three ontology language fragments, the OWL 2 profiles(EL, QL, RL)30 .","refs":[{"start":746,"end":748,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_16"}]}]},{"title":"Related Work and Conclusion","paragraphs":[{"text":"The initiatives that can be coherently compared, because oriented toward the SemWeb, and related to the specific library application domain of the descriptive metadata, are briefly summarized.","refs":[]},{"text":"The draft of the MODS RDF Ontology [16] is the semantic model expression of the MODS model and is a reference for shaping MODS resources as RDF triples. The basic conceptual assumption is similar to the SDL-SM because \"a MODS resource description includes descriptive metadata about a MODS resource\", but the ontology (coded in OWL 1 Lite31 ) defines more prescriptive constraints. The MODS XML elements are modelled 20 classes distinguished in: 1 main class (modsrdf:ModsResource), 9 MODS classes as ranges for properties whose domain is modsrdf:ModsResource, and 10 classes imported by an external ontology. Nevertheless, mostly MODS elements are modelled in 114 owl:ObjectProperty, with corresponding domain and range defined by RDFS statements. The second comparable initiative is the Bibliographic Framework Initiative (BIBFRAME) [15] where the focus is the translation of MARC 21 format to a Linked Open Data model. The BIBFRAME has defined a model consisting of 4 core classes (Creative Work, Instance, Authority, and Annotation), and a vocabulary structured over different categories of information. The BIBFRAME metamodel is designed to be lightweight, flexible and able to accommodate the declarative needs of existing descriptive standards(RDA 32 , DACS 33 , VRA 34 , etc.) and yet-to-bedeveloped community vocabularies. To best accomodate these communities the BIBFRAME RDF Schema is intentionally underspecified in terms of constraints such as domain and range. With regard to the SDL-SM, the choice of defining a conceptual reference model based on standardized and community-based semantics, and agnostic about technology, offers more flexibility and more consistency to further conceptualizations as implementation foundation. The use of digital library metadata, in a SemWeb scenario, will trespass on the hosting system boundaries, as well as the MODS conceptual assumption, and will match to other \"world\" like similar ontologies as BIBFRAME or others unpredictably similar.","refs":[{"start":338,"end":340,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_17"}]}]}],"tables":{"tab_0":{"heading":"Table 1 .","description":"MODS metadata elements and SDL profile specification occurrences","rows":[["titleInfo","7 originInfo/date","1 recordInfo","1"],["name","2 originInfo/place","1 note","2"],["abstract","4 originInfo/publisher","1 genre","2"],["accessCondition 2 originInfo/edition","1 subject","8"],["language","1 originInfo/issuance","1 relatedItem","8"],["typeOfResource 1 originInfo/frequency","1 part","2"],["identifier","1 physicalDescr./digitalOrigin","1 extension","1"],["location","2 physicalDescr./internetMediaType 1 targetAudience 1"],["tableOfContents 1 physicalDescr./form","1 classification 1"],["","physicalDescr./extent","2",""]]},"tab_1":{"heading":"4 The SDL Semantic Model for Descriptive Metadata","description":"","rows":[]}},"abstract":{"title":"Abstract","paragraphs":[{"text":"In this paper is presented the semantic model defined for descriptive metadata of resources, managed by the Sapienza Digital Library.
