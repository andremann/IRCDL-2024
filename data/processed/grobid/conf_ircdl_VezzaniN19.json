Moreover, scientific needs in fast growing domains (such as biomedicine, chemistry and ecology) and the overwhelming amount of textual data published daily demand that terminology is acquired and managed systematically and automatically.","refs":[{"start":192,"end":195,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b2"}]},{"text":"In the medical field, the need to manage data is increasingly evident, in particular in the context of health practice through the support of mobile and portable tools and in the physician-patient interactions. According to GSMA, 1 there are four major customers in the eHealth market: health-care providers, payers (both public and private health-care insurers), governments, and Healthcare consumers, each of whom have different priorities and needs. Focusing on health-care consumers, the main priority is to manage one's own health in order to have access to reliable and comprehensible medical information. For this reason, there are freely available resources [18,35], as for example Everyday Health 2  which offers personalized health advice, tools, and communities, or Medscape, 3offering medical information for specialists, physicians, and industry professionals. These tools are based on the need for effective communication between various actors and the transmission of information in a clear and understandable way. Therefore, terminology is an important issue to be considered because medical language is often characterized by a complex lexicon difficult to understand. Many studies [6,7,14,30] point out problems related to medical terminology such as semantic ambiguity, incorrect use of suffixes, archaism maintaining, redundancy in the formation of compounds, and etymological inconsistencies. As a result, patients and in general non-experts in medicine are often exposed to medical terms that can be semantically complex and hardly understandable [38].","refs":[{"start":666,"end":670,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b17"},{"start":670,"end":673,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b34"},{"start":787,"end":788,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_0"},{"start":1199,"end":1202,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b5"},{"start":1202,"end":1204,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b6"},{"start":1204,"end":1207,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b13"},{"start":1207,"end":1210,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b29"},{"start":1569,"end":1573,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b37"}]},{"text":"Public libraries have a long history of providing community outreach programs and services to their diverse user population, including aiding access to reliable consumer health information and electronic health resources and offering health-information literacy programs [39].

Despite their different levels of expertise, these people need to interact and understand each other; but, unfortunately, the communication is not always easy and effective [15,24,31]. The recent contributions of CT aim to (i) the simplification of medical texts in terms of readability and understandability and to (ii) the implementation of resources and applications in order to facilitate patient-doctor dialogue in situations of medical diagnosis. Text simplification is closely linked to the readability studies [12], the purpose of which is to address the ease with which a document can be read and understood by people. In medical texts, one source of difficulty may be due to the specific and specialized notions that are used. Indeed, the medical field conveys very specific and often opaque notions (e.g., myocardial infarction, cholecystectomy, abdominal strangulated hernia, galactose urine), that are difficult to understand by lay people. Numerous studies address these issues from different perspectives and following different computational approaches for the analysis of medical terminology such as:","refs":[{"start":145,"end":149,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b33"},{"start":324,"end":328,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b14"},{"start":328,"end":331,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b23"},{"start":331,"end":334,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b30"},{"start":669,"end":673,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b11"}]},{"text":"1. the automatic identification of specialized and non-specialized terms; 2. the identification of equivalents lay terms; 3. the identification of the level of technicality; 4. the realization of terminological resources.","refs":[]},{"text":"In [42], the authors propose an automatic method in order to distinguish between specialized and non-specialized occurrences of verbs in medical corpora.

These kinds of observations fit in the context of readability: verbs which co-occur frequently with specialized terms can be considered as sources of reading difficulties for non-experts in the medical field. Other approaches [2] try to assess the level of technicality of a term through the combination of learningto-rank techniques with statistical and linguistic features, that is the specialization degree to each of the entries given in a list of synonym terms. In [22], the authors propose a method for the classification of term technicality considering term variation in the medical field.
