Data citation is central to enable: (i) credit attribution to database creators and curators not only to papers authors; (ii) connection between scientific papers and used data; (iii) identifiability, reachability and accessibility of data; (iv) knowledge sharing and propagation; (v) evaluation of the impact of the data; (vi) reproducibility of the experiments. To date, two are the facets of data citation which have been studied: the definition of data citation principles and the development of solutions for computational problems related to the automatic or semi-automatic generation of citations. Two main international initiatives (CODATA [1] and FORCE 11 [6]) have defined core principles and criteria for data citation which are: (i) through the citation data should be identifiable on variable granularity; (ii) both citation metadata and cited data should be persistent and accessible; (iii) every citation should come with a citation reference (text-snippet) which describes the cited data and should be complete enough to attribute credit and to interpret the data content; (iv) citations should be flexible and both machine-and human-readable.

The most recent and widely recognized metadata format for citing data, DataCite [2] needs to be extended in order to represent the nanopublication citation metadata since several data within the enriched nanopublication do not find any correspondent metadata fields and some metadata fields would need to be overloaded.

Unlike existing solutions to cite nanopublications, our framework satisfies all the above requirements. The identification of the nanopublication is guaranteed by its unique identifier which is reported in the landing page, in the citation metadata and text-snippet. The data is persistent due to the nature of the nanopublication and by the nanopublication network and specification [9], besides, the citation is persistent due to the one-to-one correlation between a given nanopublication and its citation metadata and landing page (a nanopublication is always associated to the same metadata). Moreover, the citation completeness is guaranteed by the presence of all the information relative to the nanopublication in the citation metadata as well as in the landing page, which provides all the information needed to attribute the credit to whom was committed to the creation of the nanopublication and its scientific claim.

To solve all these problems we plan to extend the framework by considering some improvements as shown in Fig. 1 (green and blue nodes). Each nanopublication in the given set undergoes a dereferencing and enriching process and then is mapped into a separate metadata schema. Afterwards, the set of separate metadata are aggregated to form single metadata containing citation information common to all the nanopublications in the set. This cannot be done by performing a mere concatenation of the metadata, but by performing some operations at field-level in the set of metadata. As for the citation policies, the operations to be executed are defined by the system administrator. Then, by applying citation policies to the metadata of the overall set the text-snippet is created. Additionally, the landing page provides complete and understandable information about the content of the nanopublications in the set, alongside the link to the access to landing pages and citations of the single nanopublications.","refs":[{"start":883,"end":884,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_0"}]}]}],"tables":{},"abstract":{"title":"Abstract","paragraphs":[{"text":"Nanopublication is a data publishing model which has a great potential for the representation of scientific results allowing interoperability, data integration and exchange of scientific findings.
