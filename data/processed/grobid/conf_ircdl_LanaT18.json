But the same cartographical query can produce lists of authors, works, passages, mentioning places belonging to the area traced by the reader on the map. Or inversely the reader starts from one or more works and can display on the map the places mentioned in those works. The apparently simple scope of searching can become very powerful if one considers that in the annotation of places events and involved people with their roles can be described. This way one can search e.g. for the geographical places where proconsules are mentioned. This is not possible with more simple NER approaches where the place name is a string and not -as it happens instead when using an underlying rich ontology -a complex entity of meaning full of connections and implications.","refs":[]},{"text":"In the second scope the concept of \"digital edition of a text\" is developed/expanded. The \"edition of a text\" has today -at least for classical works, but many things are similar for the editions of medieval or modern texts -two main forms: with or without the description of the variants and their evaluation by the curator of the edition in the apparatus criticus. In the first case the edition is usually qualified as a scholarly edition, in the second one it is usually called a variorum edition. In both cases the editor of the texts offers what he judges being the best reconstruction of the true text issued by the hand of the author. And this type of work on the text was consolidated through thousands of years (the first critical editions of texts were produced more than 2000 years ago). The scope of a scholarly edition (be it of the first or of the second type just described) is that of offering those who want to study a given work a rich informational environment. Until these years the main type of information offered is that of an accurate description of the state of the manuscript tradition. Nowadays, tools are available allowing to expand the type of critically assessed information which is offered to the researchers who study a given text, what is both the cause and the effect of new study perspectives. For example, we are more aware of the fact that the geography conveys political and ideological meanings: giving names to specific points on the surface of Earth means affirming a property on them; the same is for defining boundaries; and mentioning specific place names in groups is a way of declaring interpretations of facts, or of affirming political or religious positions. This type of research interest needs the support of an edition of the text giving space to this study approach: a geographer will probably appreciate a scholarly edition enriched by a geographical apparatus that is an edition with a good comment of the text plus a full spectrum of documentation about the geographical knowledge contained in the text that is link the source describing in all the possible ways the places which are mentioned (Fig. 2): while a classical scholar will probably appreciate a scholarly variorum edition enriched by a geographical apparatus, that is an edition where it is possible to cross-reference the variants of the manuscript tradition with the geographical knowledge. But other types of information could be equally interesting: historical information about the events mentioned in the text, or prosopographical information about the persons involved in the events, or both types merged.

In other words we suggest here that the complexity of the digital edition be conceived not at the very philological level only (as variorum edition, with complex discussions about what it must contain and how the content must be presented also in rapport with the printed version of this type of edition) but also as a research tool which creates a research environment which configures itself according to the scope and the interests of the researcher/reader (Fig. 3).","refs":[{"start":858,"end":859,"marker":"figure","target":null}]},{"text":"All the above is possible because the specific value of a digital edition is not only in the digital form of representation of textual information: dynamic rather than static, resulting in better visual or practical usability; but it mainly lays in the ability to work with computational methods on the text and on the information it conveys [12,13].","refs":[{"start":342,"end":346,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b11"},{"start":346,"end":349,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b12"}]},{"text":"In conclusion, the digital edition of a text should aim to provide adequate data and functionality to further forms of processing.
