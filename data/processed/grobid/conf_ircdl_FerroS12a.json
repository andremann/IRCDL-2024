The principle of provenance leads archivists to evaluate records on the basis of the importance of the creator's mandate and functions, and fosters the use of a hierarchical method for describing the archives. Although this practice is still vitally important for the archives, the archivists also need more powerful tools to capture the complexity of the reality of interest. Indeed, the reality of modern records creation is that documents may exist in \"multiple contexts and have multiple and complex relationships that describe their significance and value\" [9].

An archive is the trace of the activities of a physical or juridical person in the course of their business which is preserved because of their continued value. Archives have to keep the context in which their records have been created and the network of relationships between them in order to preserve their informative content and provide understandable and useful information over time [6]. The context and the relationships between the documents are preserved thanks to the hierarchical organization of the documents inside the archive. Indeed, an archive is divided by fonds and then by sub-fonds and then by series and then by sub-series and so on -see Figure 2a for an example; at every level we can find documents belonging to a particular division of the archive or documents describing the nature of the considered level of the archive. The union of all these documents, the relationships and the context information enables the full informational power of the archival documents to be maintained. The archival documents are analyzed, organized, and recorded by means of archival descriptions [15] that have to reflect the peculiarities of the archive [3].","refs":[{"start":429,"end":432,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b5"},{"start":706,"end":708,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_1"},{"start":1143,"end":1147,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b14"},{"start":1202,"end":1205,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b2"}]},{"text":"In a digital environment an archive and its components are described by using the metadata that have to be able to express and maintain such structure  and relationships.

In an EAD file the information about fonds, sub-fonds and series are mapped into several nested elements and the archival structure is maintained by a collection of nested <cN> tags (e.g. <c02 label=\"Series\"> in Figure 1). EAD describes an archive as a unique monolithic resource; indeed, it is not an aggregation of metadata each describing a single part of the archive, but a monolithic metadata where every subcomponent describes a different division or document of the archive. In order to access a specific division of an archive described by EAD we may need to navigate the whole XML hierarchy; otherwise, it is also possible to define an ad-hoc solution, for instance using XPointers3 , to provide direct access to frequently requested archival divisions encoded by EAD subcomponents.","refs":[{"start":301,"end":302,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_0"},{"start":396,"end":400,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b16"},{"start":722,"end":723,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_0"},{"start":1193,"end":1194,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_1"}]},{"text":"Each <cN> tag of the EAD may contain a description of a digital object or a bunch of digital objects.

To this end EAD provides a <dao> tag which allows us to specify a URI to an external digital object which is part of the described material (see Figure 1a); furthermore, EAD also provides an <extptr> element to point to a digital object that is not part of the described materials [13]. By means of these tags we can link one external digital object to each archival division; if we need to link more than one digital object to a specific division we have to exploit third-party components -i.e. the so-called \"digital wrappers\"4 ; a relevant example is the Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard (METS) metadata that is used as an in-between component for relating a bunch of digital objects to an EAD component [19,14] -see Figure 1b.","refs":[{"start":361,"end":365,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b12"},{"start":519,"end":521,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_0"},{"start":648,"end":652,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b12"},{"start":895,"end":896,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_2"},{"start":1085,"end":1089,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b18"},{"start":1089,"end":1092,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b13"},{"start":1105,"end":1107,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_0"}]},{"text":"The NESTOR Model.

Indeed, we can represent the archival structure by means of a collection of nested sets where each set represents an archival division and contains the metadata describing the resources belonging to that division [4].

An organization of sets in the NS-M is a collection of sets in which any pair of sets is either disjoint or one contains the other. In Figure 2 we can see how a sample tree representing an archive is mapped into an organization of nested sets based on the NS-M -for the moment please ignore the elements belonging to the sets. We can see that each node of the tree is mapped into a set, where child nodes become proper subsets of the set created from the parent node. Every set is subset of at least one set; the set corresponding to the tree root is the only set without any supersets and every set in the hierarchy is subset of the root set. The external nodes are sets with no subsets. The tree structure is maintained thanks to the nested organization and the relationships between the sets are expressed by the set inclusion order. Even the disjunction between two sets brings information; indeed, the disjunction of two sets means that these belong to two different branches of the same tree. In [4] a methodology is described for mapping an EAD file into the NESTOR Model which preserves the full informative power of the metadata. [4] shows that the EAD is mapped into a NS-C which retains the EAD structure and a collection of lightweight metadata -e.g. Dublin Core Application Profile5 which contains the content of archival descriptions. In this way, the NESTOR Model can be used as a model to describe an archive from scratch as well as a mapping component that allows us to manipulate and transform the EAD files while respecting archival principles [5].","refs":[{"start":294,"end":295,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_1"},{"start":1154,"end":1157,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b3"},{"start":1291,"end":1294,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b3"},{"start":1446,"end":1447,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_3"},{"start":1715,"end":1718,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b4"}]}]},{"title":"Oai-ore.","paragraphs":[{"text":"The OAI-ORE defines a machine-readable and standard mechanism for defining aggregations of resources on the Web.

Some examples [20] of these are a digitized book that is an aggregation of chapters, where each chapter is an aggregation of scanned pages, and a scholarly publication that is an aggregation of text and supporting materials such as datasets, software tools, and video recordings of an experiment; also the archives can be seen as aggregations of archival metadata describing archival objects which in turn can have a digital form.","refs":[{"start":468,"end":472,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b19"}]},{"text":"The OAI-ORE data model is based on three main kinds of resources: Aggregation, Aggregated Resources and Resource Map.

We need to define a mapping between a NS-C C and an OAI-ORE model O = E, Φ ; in order to do this we have to take into account the two main entities of the NESTOR Model which are: the sets and the resources belonging to them.","refs":[]},{"text":"The intuitive idea is that every set H ∈ C becomes an Aggregation a h ∈ A and consequently, every resource r t ∈ R belonging to H becomes an aggregated resource ar t ∈ AR aggregated by a h . Furthermore, for every pair of sets {H, K} ∈ C | H ⊆ K it is possible to create a pair of aggregations {a h , a k } ∈ A such that a h ≺ a a k where ≺ a is a binary relation between aggregations.","refs":[]},{"text":"Every set in a collection of subsets can be mapped into an Aggregation in the OAI-ORE model; the inclusion order between the sets is maintained by the binary relation defined between the nested Aggregations of OAI-ORE. Then, by the means of the function ϕ RMA a Resource Map is associated with each Aggregation. Every resource belonging to a set H in the NS-C is mapped into an Aggregated Resources belonging to the Aggregation mapped from H. Thus, we can map a NS-C into a correspondent OAI-ORE model being sure that the hierarchical dependencies are properly retained. This means that if we model an archive through a NS-C then we define an OAI-ORE instance of the archive which retains the original hierarchical structure of the archive.","refs":[]}]},{"title":"How to Model an Archive as an OAI-ORE Instance","paragraphs":[{"text":"The presented formal basis guarantees that an archive modeled by means of the NS-M can be mapped into an instance of the OAI-ORE Data Model retaining the ","refs":[]}]},{"title":"Table F","paragraphs":[{"text":"The use of property \"isMetadataOf\" fundamental archival hierarchy.

In \"Table A\" we can see the mapping of the sets into the OAI-ORE Aggregations and in \"Table B\" we can see how the inclusion dependencies are mapped into Nested Aggregations.

The set \"sub-fondsA\" contains only a metadata (i.e. m 2 ), the set \"seriesA\" contains a metadata (i.e m 3 ) and an associated digital object (i.e. do 3 ), and so on and so forth. In \"Table C  the Aggregated Resource ar a is a metadata describing the digital object ar b . In the same way we can define a linear order between the Aggregated Resources as we have shown in Figure 3 where we defined a \"hasNext\" relationship between the Proxies \"p 1 \" and \"p 2 \". The relationships between the Aggregated Resources can reflect the order between the archival descriptions within a common archival division; in this way, we are sure that the OAI-ORE representation of the archive respects the original order principle. We can see that within this methodology it is quite simple to extend the range of the relationships connecting the Aggregated Resources and to define in this way new semantic associations between the archival resources.","refs":[{"start":397,"end":398,"marker":"table","target":null},{"start":585,"end":586,"marker":"figure","target":null}]},{"text":"In Figure 4 we can see the RDF graph representing the OAI-ORE instance of the sample archive in Figure 2b.

This methodology makes it possible to model and describe the archives from scratch by means of OAI-ORE while allowing archivists to easily express relationships between archival metadata and digital objects. Archival principles are preserved and still have primary importance for understanding archival resources; at the same time, OAI-ORE offers the possibility of defining new relationships between the resources enabling the definition of new services over the archives. Moreover, this methodology provides a means to define archival compound objects that can be shared with the systems which already employ OAI-ORE and related technologies.","refs":[{"start":10,"end":11,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_3"},{"start":103,"end":105,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_1"}]},{"text":"On the other hand, this methodology and the described formal basis guarantee the backward compatibility with other archival descriptive standards; for instance, a methodology to map the archival descriptions modeled by OAI-ORE into EAD can be easily defined.

In the same way, we can map the archival descriptions modeled by OAI-ORE into an EAD file by reversing the presented methodology 11 .
