Not only have these disciplines played a major role in increasing public awareness of the great social, historical and cultural significance embodied in such \"documents of reality\", but they have also developed specific categories and interpretative tools to understand the language of that specific means of expression (Fig. 1). Over the last few years, libraries, archives and museums (LAMs) have tried to support non-expert users by providing innovative ways of searching and browsing that go beyond the query-response paradigm. Content-based indexing has offered in this regard an alternative way of exploring and engaging with digital cultural heritage resources [27]. At its most basic level, content-based indexing allows users to search for images by means of visual features such as color, shape and texture. However, these are low-level features, with limited descriptive power as regards the semantics of an image. A more suitable approach to improve retrieval is suggested by research conducted in domains like medical informatics, wherein visual content is combined with text-based data [2].","refs":[{"start":423,"end":424,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_0"},{"start":765,"end":769,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b26"},{"start":1197,"end":1200,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b1"}]},{"text":"Unlike content-based indexing, concept-based indexing represents subject matter through descriptive terms taken directly from natural language, as is the case of social tagging, or through corresponding descriptors chosen from a controlled vocabulary.

It begins with determining what a document is about and goes on with a conceptual analysis and translation into a controlled terminology. However, it must be said that what about-ness really is remains controversial. From a very pragmatic point of view, about-ness can be considered as a variable, mainly affected by the type of language used: referential language refers to the objective reality, hence sentences are about their subjects, while representational or emotive language communicates or excites feelings [26] (pp. 46-48).","refs":[{"start":613,"end":617,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b25"}]},{"text":"While determining the subject of a text according to the so-called grammar model (a careful examination of virtually any sentences making up the text) is somewhat problematic, determining the subject of, say, a photographic image is in general relatively straightforward as its referent or its genuine essence is \"la chose nécessairement réelle qui à été placée devant l'objectif, faute de quoi il n'y aurait pas de photographie\" [4] (p. 120). However, the referent is not enough to grasp the whole meaning of a photographic image. In Henry Ziegler's portrait of his cousin Gaspard, the pocket watch shown by the sitter might now suggest a simple reflection on the flow of time, while for a contemporary observer it meant the long time of the pose typical of early photographic processes [6]. This intended meaning is, in Barthes' words, studium [4] (pp. 47-48), which typically requires skills and knowledge other than those possessed by the layperson. Another much more problematic concept coined by Barthes is punctum. This is something present in the image that immediately jumps out at the viewers as unusual or unexpected and triggers in them a feeling, thought or memory. Therefore, punctum belongs entirely to the sphere of the beholder's subjectivity [4] (pp. 48-49). Barthes' considerations seem to offer a good basis for reconsidering the most common concept-based approaches currently underlying subject indexing of images as they provide for a differentiation between intersubjective and subjective meaning.","refs":[{"start":430,"end":433,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b3"},{"start":788,"end":791,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b5"},{"start":846,"end":849,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b3"},{"start":1260,"end":1263,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b3"}]},{"text":"A complementary, albeit different, approach reported in the vast literature on image indexing is that of German art historian Erwin Panofsky [22]. His Studies in Iconology (1939) has had a strong influence on art history research and proven to be a valuable method for analyzing the subject of a work of art. In his model, Panofsky identifies three layers of subject matter in a work of art: (1) primary or natural subject matter (pre-iconographic description); (2) secondary or conventional subject matter (iconographic identification), and (3) intrinsic meaning (iconological interpretation). At the first level, perception yields factual meaning, i.e. referential meaning (objects, events), but psychological nuances (expressional meaning) can possibly emerge as well. At the second level, referents are related to the relevant frame of conventional values (social, art historical etc.). Finally, the third level is concerned with the essential or intrinsic meaning of an image, which is grasped by widening the analysis to the religious, social, historical and philosophical context in which the work of art was created. At this level, a work of art is understood to be symptomatic of a worldview (Weltanschauung) [22] (pp. 5-8 and 14-25).","refs":[{"start":141,"end":145,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b21"},{"start":1218,"end":1222,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b21"}]},{"text":"Panofsky's model has been largely deployed in image indexing, albeit modified to merely fit instrumental and pragmatic needs. Indeed, what was originally conceived as a unitary process geared towards understanding the inner essence of a work of art that encompasses the whole continuum of the interpretive spectrum has been regrettably turned into no more than a set of procedural guidelines mainly focused on the pre-iconographic and iconographic levels (see for example [19]). For this, as well as other reasons, Panofsky's model (1939) has been recently criticized and challenged by some scholars, who have called for a rethinking of the theoretical and practical foundations of image indexing (for example [10]). However, when going back to the apparently banal example given by Panofsky in the Introductory of his Studies (1939) -a natural event of the everyday life -one cannot overlook the fact that it was purposely chosen \"to exemplify the minimal [bold mine] features of visual communication and representation\", and to serve as a \"baseline from which to measure more complex\" forms of \"visual representation\" (cf. [21], p. 26). Therefore, it is not a matter of doing Panofsky's model anew or simply to scale it down from the level of iconological interpretation to that of the minimal features of non-art imagery. Rather one should acknowledge that there are methodological differences in approaching the problem of subject indexing of images and that the building blocks of a heuristic model for subject access to non-art imagery are to be laid on the basis of the analysis of images that represent events of everyday life like the one described in Panofsky's model. Shatford Layne's contribution to image indexing, on both the theoretical and practical level, appears to address many of the issues surrounding this point [25]. Her framework for analyzing the subject of an image consists of: (1) a description in generic terms (generic of-ness), (2) identification in specific terms (specific of-ness), and ( 3) interpretation (about-ness). The main limit of this framework becomes immediately clear when analyzing Fig. 1. The content of this photographic image is actually readable only at the first two levels: (1) women and children (generic of-ness), and (2) embroiderers (specific of-ness). The third level of meaning, i.e. the meaning to which the image referent alludes, is problematic because there is no readily available information in the image pointing to some underlying message.

About-ness then is the constitutive factor that differentiates art images from non-art images. However, since non-art images are not only a representation of reality but also, in Barthes' words, prompters of punctum, it follows that: (1) the analysis of non-art images should not be limited to the generic-tospecific continuum of the spectrum making up the description and identification of the reality depicted in an image in order to fit it into categories according to some schema; (2) it is appropriate to provide additional or alternative points of view, i.e. access points to the who, what, when and where that are right there (there-ness) in, rather than about, an image. If neither the interaction between studium and punctum nor the rules for knowing the punctum can be established in advance, then the analysis of the content of non-art images should take place solely at the of-ness level.

Indeed, the large-scale application of FA to information architectures designed for the Web dates to early 2000s. From then onwards, facets have become the standard way in which e-commerce websites organize their content [28]. However, it must be said that the notion of facet underlying this ever-growing trend goes far beyond the original meaning and is indicative of a major conceptual shift wherein a \"generic term used to denote any component of a compound subject\" [23] (p. 88) has in the end become any attribute of a resource. This widespread understanding of facets seems to reflect the way in which FA has been received in Northern America. Two cases in point are the Faceted Access to Subject Terminology (FAST) project by OPACs 2.0, featuring Endeca Guided Search [7], and the principles set out in the ANSI/NISO Z39. 19-2005 (2010) standard, where one reads that: (1) the possible attributes or facets of a resource are subject (indexing string), author, location, form, language; and (2) the concept of facet basically corresponds to that of attribute in the computing field.","refs":[{"start":147,"end":150,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b7"},{"start":152,"end":155,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b8"},{"start":530,"end":534,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b27"},{"start":780,"end":784,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b22"},{"start":1085,"end":1088,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b6"},{"start":1139,"end":1153,"marker":"bibr","target":null}]},{"text":"Unlike these examples, the notion of facet borrowed here follows that of the mathematician and librarian Ranganathan.

A hierarchical structure consists of a classed system organized according to a top-down approach, starting from the most generic concept -the most top-level class -and then dividing it into sub-classes of increasing specificity. In general, a subject can be divided and subdivided according to different characteristics and levels of specificity. However, in practice, both division and specificity should reflect the distinctions and level of analysis by which the subject matter is, so to speak, naturally structured. For this reason, it is more convenient to develop a system on a pragmatic basis, rather than a philosophical one. The best approach is to compromise and seek the right balance between literary and user warrant. On the one hand, the structure should basically conform to the way in which the subject matter is represented in the relevant literature, but on the other hand it should be accessible in much the same way as users search for this type of information in the related literature and in online settings.","refs":[]},{"text":"A good example briefly illustrating the pros and cons of this approach are those images whose subject falls under the category Building(s).

This, on the one hand, results in the inevitable scattering of the subordinate attributes (distributed relatives), but on the other hand it represents the prescribed and predictable sequence by which concepts are not only sorted but also accessed (citation order ). In this respect, if the main concern is to first find buildings in a given area, and then their types and components, the citation order will perfectly match the users' interest. On the contrary, if the initial focus is on types, in order to collect every piece of relevant information, users have to browse every single place. Therefore, when deciding on the order in which the attributes should be placed, one should carefully consider which order is more likely to fit the needs of the intended users, as well as which aspects are of primary importance and which ones can be distributed instead [9] (pp. [8][9][10][11][12].

However, as already mentioned, some reasonable compromise or balance between literary and user warrant is necessary when choosing the characteristics for each class. Such characteristics are called facets and identify the properties used to model the information space of interest [29] (pp. 12-13).

Non-expert or naive users perform core exploratory tasks and issue short general queries returning large result sets [3].
