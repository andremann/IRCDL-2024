On the other hand, this system does not provide a suitable means to automatically generate human-and machine-readable citations. In [24] a rulebased citation system that creates machine-and human-readable citations by using only the information present in the data has been proposed for citing XML. This system has been extended into a methodology that works with database views provided that the data to be cited can be represented as a hierarchy [22]; this work has been further extended for general queries over relational databases in [28][29][30]. [55] proposed a methodology for citing XML data based on machine learning techniques, which allows us to create citations with variable granularity learning from examples and reducing the human effort to a minimum. In [54] a methodology based on named meta-graphs to cite RDF sub-graphs has been proposed; this solution for RDF graphs targets the variable granularity problem and proposes an approach to create human-readable and machine-actionable data citations even though the actual elements composing a citation are not automatically selected. In the context of RDF citation, [40] proposed the nanopublication model where a single statement RDF triple is made citable in its own right; the idea is to enrich a statement via annotations adding context information such as time, authority and provenance.

Persistent identifiers are foundational for data citation, but they represent just one part of the solution since they do not allow us to create citations with variable granularity, unless we create a unique identifier for each single datum in a dataset, which in most of the cases may be unfeasible.

Now let us look at changes of the other components: R → R : When the research goal is changed, then we re-purpose some of the components of the experiment for another research question (for example, performing interactive retrieval experiments). So method and implementation usually are also changed, and other components as well. M → M : Most of the research in the field of IR deals with the investigation of alternative methods (retrieval models, formulas). This implies also a new implementation I , which often runs on a different platform. However, for performing comparisons, the (input) data should be the same. I → I : Here a researcher uses a different implementation, say Terrier instead of Lemur, or does their own reimplementation. P → P : In most cases, independent researchers do not have access to the platform used in the original experiment. Even different versions of system libraries, or external resources such as dictionaries, might have subtle effects on the outcome of experiments. D → D : Rerunning an experiment with different parameters might be useful for testing the robustness of a method. Applying the implementation to different input data (for example, test collections) aims at investigating the generality of the method.","refs":[]},{"text":"For ensuring reproducibility, there is the need to be able to share as many PRIMAD components as possible. Research goal and method are what we currently share via publications in conference proceedings or journals (although details of the method are often missing). Sharing implementations are possible via making it open source and uploading it on Web sites focusing on this task (for example, Github). Platforms can be shared by means of virtual machines or dockers, or by \"evaluation as a service\". For the input data, there are a number of standard test collections which are generally available. When researchers use their own test collection, however, reproducibility can only be ensured in case this collection is shared with the community, ideally via a trustworthy repository.","refs":[]},{"text":"However, also in this case, we note a lack of attention to data citation. Indeed, the PRIMAD model allows us to have a common framework to describe what has changed from one experiment to another and to clearly define the kind of reproduciblity we are achieving (or not). Nevertheless, all these changes modeled by the framework should be backed by a proper data citation mechanism that allows us to track them and to reference back to them.","refs":[]},{"text":"There have been early examples of systems to manage IR experimental data, such as EvaluatIR [13] and Distributed Information Retrieval Evaluation Campaign Tool (DIRECT)5 [4,6], but they have not been designed with reproducibility and/or data citation as goals.
