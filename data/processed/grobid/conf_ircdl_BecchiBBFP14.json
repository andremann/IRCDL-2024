data in recent times, in its varied forms and formats (H.264 and Flash videos, MP3 and Wav audio, HTML and PDF documents, images), requires the creation of effective tools to organize, manage and link digital resources, in order to maximize accessibility and reduce cost issues for everyone concerned, from content managers to online content consumers. On a larger scale, isolated multimedia repositories developed by content owners and technology providers can be connected, unleashing opportunities for innovative user services and creating new business models, in the vein of on-demand, online or mobile TV ventures. The system presented in this paper stems from above conditions and potentialities to connect publicly available multimedia information streams under a unifying framework, which additionally allows publishers of audio-visual content to monetize their products and services. The backbone of the system, developed within two EU funded projects (IM3I and euTV), is a scalable audio-visual analysis and indexing system that allows detection and tracking of vast amounts of multimedia content based on Topics of Interest (TOI), that correspond to a user's profile and set of employed search terms. The frontend is a portal that can be customized to be suitable to different scenarios and scopes, displaying syndicated content, allowing users to perform searches, refine queries, and produce faceted presentation of results.","refs":[]},{"text":"In this paper we present an interactive multi-user multimedia retrieval framework composed by: i) a SOA-based system that provides services for semantic and syntactic annotation, search and browsing for different media such as videos, images, text and audio that belong to different domains (possibly modeled with different ontologies) with query expansion and ontology reasoning; ii) web-based interfaces for interactive query composition, archive browsing, annotation and visualization. The usability of the system has been assessed in field trials performed by professional video archivists and multimedia professionals, proving that the system is effective, efficient and satisfactory for users. The paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 briefly describes the state-of-the-art related to the main topics of this work, in Sect. 3 the architecture and the main functions of the framework are discussed; Sect. 4 reports on the usability assessment techniques used and on the outcomes of the field trials.","refs":[]}]},{"title":"Related work","paragraphs":[{"text":"A thorough review of concept-based video retrieval has been presented by Snoek et al. 31 . The approach currently achieving the best performance in semantic concept annotation in competitions like TRECVid 29 or PASCAL VOC 18 is based on the bag-of-words (BoW) approach 30 . The bag-of-words approach has been initially proposed for text document categorization, but can be applied to visual content analysis 15,22,28 , treating an image or keyframe as the visual analog of a document that is represented by a bag of quantized descriptors (e.g. SIFT), referred to as visualwords. A comprehensive study on this approach has been presented by Zhang et al. 40 , considering the classification of object categories; a review of action detection and recognition methods has been recently provided by Ballan et al. 4 . Since the BoW approach disregards the spatial layout of the features, some researchers have proposed several methods to incorporate the spatial information to improve classification results 5 : Lazebnik et al 24 have proposed to perform pyramid matching in the two-dimensional image space, while Bronstein et al. 11 have proposed the construction of vocabularies of spatial relations between features.

It uses an ontology that has been created semi-automatically from a flat lexicon and a basic lightweight ontology structure, using WordNet to create concept relations (is a, is part of and has part). The ontology is modeled following the Dynamic Pictorially Enriched Ontology model 8 , that includes both concepts and visual concept prototypes. These prototypes represent the different visual modalities in which a concept can manifest; they can be selected by the users to perform query by example, using MPEG-7 descriptors (e.g. Color Layout and Edge Histogram) or other domain specific visual descriptors. Concepts, concepts relations, video annotations and visual concept prototypes are defined using the standard Web Ontology Language (OWL) so that the ontology can be easily reused and shared. The queries created in each interface are translated by the search engine into SPARQL, the W3C standard ontology query language. The system extends the queries adding synonyms and concept specializations through ontology reasoning and the use of WordNet. As an example consider the query \"find shots with vehicles\": the concept specializations expansion through inference over the ontology structure permits to retrieve the shots annotated with \"vehicle\" and also those annotated with the concept's specializations (e.g. \"trucks\", \"cars\", etc.). In particular, WordNet query expansion, using synonyms, is enabled when using freetext queries, since it is not desirable to force the user to formulate a query selecting only the terms from a predefined lexicon. As an example consider the case in which a user types the word \"automobile\": also videos that have been annotated using the word \"car\" will be returned. The search engine provides also services for browsing the ontology structure and to filter query results using metadata, like programme names or geolocalization information.","refs":[{"start":67,"end":68,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b5"},{"start":660,"end":661,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b7"}]}]},{"title":"The web-based user interfaces","paragraphs":[{"text":"The web-based search and browse system, based on the Rich Internet Application paradigm (RIA), does not require any software installation and it is composed by several integrated and specialized interfaces.

The extended video player allows also searching for visually similar video shots, using the CBIR search interface Daphnis. Furthermore another interface (Andromeda), also integrated with Sirio, allows to browse video archives navigating through the relations between the concepts of the ontology and providing direct access to the instances of these concepts; this functionality is useful when a user does not have a clear idea regarding the query that he wants to make. The Andromeda interface is based on some graphical elements typical of web 2.0 interfaces, such as the tag cloud. The user starts selecting concepts from a tag cloud, than navigates the ontology that describes the video domain, shown as a graph with different types of relations, and inspects the video clips that contain the instances of the annotated concepts.
