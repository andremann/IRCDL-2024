Another SNA tool that is used in the academic field is Flink [11]. The system performs the extraction, aggregation, and visualization of on-line social networks and it has been exploited to generate a Web-based representation of the Semantic Web community. In [8] the problem of content-based social network discovery among people who appear in Google News is studied: probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis [7] and clustering techniques have been exploited to obtain a topic-based representation.

Our approach is twofold: we take into account social connections between events, considering the authors who contributed, and the semantic connections, analysing the topics discussed. These two different perspectives are then used to get a better overall picture of the considered research community. The testbed system is constituted by three modules: the Data Acquisition (DA) module, the Content Extraction (CE) module, and the Graph Builder (GB) module, as shown in Fig. 1. The DA module reads the considered documents and populates the Event Data repository, that contains the list of considered events and their related data including contributing authors, venue, date, and links to full text papers. The CE module retrieves the full text of each considered paper and acts as interface for a Keyphrase Extraction system. Such system extracts a set of meaningful keyphrases (KPs) from each article's full text using the algorithm described in [5]. Keyphrases identify relevant concepts in the document and each of them is associated with an estimated relevance score called keyphraseness. Keyphraseness is evaluated using a knowledge-based approach that exploits different kinds of knowledge: Statistical Knowledge, Linguistic Knowledge, Meta/Structural Knowledge, and Semantic/Social Knowledge [4]. Keyphraseness therefore can be considered a fine estimation of the real relevance of a phrase inside a long text such as a scholarly paper.

Subsequently, a Topic Graph (TG) is built, where events are represented by nodes and the fact that two events share some keyphrases is represented by an undirected link between such nodes. Nodes are weighted according to the number of different keyphrases extracted from their papers, and links according to the sum of CK -IDF values of the keyphrases shared between two events.

There is an higher number of clusters and, even though many events remain isolated, more events are grouped in a cluster. The largest cluster includes two of the most central events, namely CLEF and UMAP, meaning that, although merging different communities, they deal with similar or tightly related topics. ISWC, the most central event in the AG, however, in the TG is included in a relatively small cluster in which only few of its co-located events appear. The majority of the events that are included in the ISWC cluster in the AG are, indeed, in the TG included in the UMAP/CLEF cluster or form a cluster on their own, like the ISWC Developers' Workshop and the LinkedUp Challenge. Several other small clusters are present, representing topics discussed only by a handful of events.","refs":[{"start":193,"end":194,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_2"}]},{"text":"One final interesting insight about what research communities actually debate can be obtained by looking at the extracted concepts with the lowest IDF, which means the most widely used in the considered data set.

Semantic Web, in particular, appears in almost half of the considered events, even if the Semantic Web research community identified by cluster analysis is far from including half of the considered events.","refs":[]}]},{"title":"IRCDL Proceedings Analysis","paragraphs":[{"text":"The second case study is focused on the evolution over time of the academic debate within a single community. Since our interest is focused on topics, only the TG of these events is generated. To achieve temporal modelling, papers are grouped by year, then using the approach described in Sect. 3 to model the TG, every group of papers is represented as a node in a network. The first relevant insight about how the scientific debate evolved over time is given by the mere distribution of extracted topics among the considered years: buzzwords come and go and their presence inside the full text of published papers reflects the trends in the research community. The fraction of papers including a specific term is a significant measure of how much widespread such term is at a specific time. In Fig. 5 we show the result of this kind of analysis over the 10-years-wise most relevant buzzwords found in the IRCDL proceeedings. It can be noticed how \"Digital Libraries\", which is the focus of the conference, is by far the most widespread term and consistently appeared in accepted papers over the ten years. On the other hand, some growing and diminishing trends can be easily spotted: \"Information Retrieval\" was a widespread topic in the first editions, however in the more recent ones its presence diminished significantly; \"Cultural Heritage\", instead has encountered a growing popularity in recent editions while is was somehow less relevant in first ones. This analysis, however, does not provides actual insights on the topics that actually characterized a specific year or a given time frame in research. In other words it does not answers the question \"what was that year about?\". To achieve this goal we must evaluate a time-wise IDF that allows us to set apart buzzwords consistently present in the domain and concepts that surfaced only in a certain time frame. Again, creating a Topic Graph where papers are grouped by year to form nodes allows this kind of analysis.","refs":[{"start":801,"end":802,"marker":"figure","target":null}]},{"text":"Figure 6 shows the Topic Graph built upon IRCDL accepted papers grouped by year annotated with the most significant topics for each node (i.e. the ones with the highest CK -IDF ). In this graph nodes represent editions of the conference, the larger the node is drawn, the more distinct topics were extracted from its associated papers; the presence of an arc between two nodes implies a significant overlap in the associated topics. Nodes in the figure are coloured according to their centrality with a \"hot\" color (tending to red) meaning a high centrality in the network. Highly central nodes, such as the 2007 edition are to be considered turning points in the history of the conference, since they represent a bridge between distinct groups of topic-wise similar editions. It is interesting to note how, in this example, the part of the graph representing the first editions of the conference is relatively sparse indicating little overlap aside from buzzwords, while more recent editions are much more connected, indicating a great deal of shared topics which implies that the conference has found a consistent core of topics.","refs":[{"start":7,"end":8,"marker":"figure","target":null}]}]},{"title":"Conclusions and Future Works","paragraphs":[{"text":"In this paper we presented a new approach to discover the semantic and social relations among scientific conferences with the aim of discovering shared interests, spotting research communities and, hopefully, help scientist addressing the problem of finding the right venue for their work.

On the other hand, our approach exploits state of the art knowledge extraction techniques to investigate the topics actually dealt by a community and, by comparing the topology of the SNA based model and the content-based model one can identify communities that deal with the same topics, but have little or no social connections at all. Identifying such communities, in our opinion, might help scholars to find relevant literature and, hopefully, to foster knowledge transfer from one community to another, improving the quality of research. Editors and organizers as well might obtain from temporal analysis meaningful insights over the trends within their community and exploit such information to provide a more attractive venue or tracks for authors.","refs":[]},{"text":"However, we won't proceed further in these speculation and simply conclude this work remarking that, due to the modularity and domain independent nature of the system and methodology here proposed, the analysis presented could be easily applied to others languages, domains, and communities.","refs":[]},{"text":"As future work, we are planning to apply our techniques over larger data sets, possibly with the collaboration of scientific journal editors, to model entire domains such as Computer Science, Mathematics, and Environmental Sciences, rather than relatively small subsets like in this introductory work.","refs":[]}]}],"tables":{"tab_0":{"heading":"Table 1 .","description":"Author Graph global statistics # of edges Average degree Network diameter Graph density Average Path length","rows":[["405","6","8","0.045","3.078"]]},"tab_1":{"heading":"Table 2 .","description":"Topic Graph global statistics # of edges Average degree Network diameter Graph density Average Path length","rows":[["8543","126.56","2","0.94","1.041"]]},"tab_2":{"heading":"Table 3 .","description":"Most commonly extracted keyphrases ranked by their IDF","rows":[["Topic","IDF"],["system","0.427"],["model","0.474"],["data","0.601"],["information","0.671"],["computer science","0.700"],["semantic web","1.076"],["language","1.144"],["web","1.144"],["semantics","1.191"],["software engineering","1.241"],["natural language processing 1.267"],["machine learning","1.267"]]}},"abstract":{"title":"Abstract","paragraphs":[{"text":"Several works in literature investigated the activities of research communities using big data analysis, but the large majority of them focuses on papers and co-authorship relations, ignoring that most of the scientific literature available is already clustered into journals and conferences with a well defined domain of interest.

We claim that such content-based analysis may lead us to a better understanding of the research communities' activities and their emerging trends. In this work we present a novel method for research communities activity analysis, based on the combination of the results of a Social Network Analysis phase and a Content-Based one.
