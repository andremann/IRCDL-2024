The concept extends beyond communication and information technologies to encompass learning, critical thinking, and interpretative skills across and beyond professional and educational boundaries\" [24] and the AGID2 Information literacy definition \"l'insieme di abilità, competenze, conoscenze e attitudini che portano il singolo a maturare nel tempo, durante tutto l'arco della vita, un rapporto complesso e diversificato con le fonti informative: i documenti e le informazioni in essi contenuti. … In sintesi la competenza informativa prevede la capacità di riconoscere un bisogno informativo, ricercare, valutare, utilizzare le informazioni in modo consapevole per creare nuova conoscenza.\" [25] while at the same time declaring the need for \"una definizione operativa e agile di IL, complementare a quelle prodotte da IFLA e AGID, che rifletta le peculiarità dello scenario italiano e europeo\". So, at definitions level things are a little blurred. But on the relation of Information Literacy with citizenship in the Information Society the statements are unambiguous: \"l'Information Literacy è un diritto di base per i cittadini\" 3 ; \"l'Information Literacy fa parte di una costellazione più ampia che include competenze necessarie per esercitare i propri diritti civili politici economici sociali e culturali; acquisire e applicare nuove competenze, arricchire la propria identità ed espressione culturale, partecipare al processo decisionale ed alla vita di una società civile attiva e impegnata\" 4 .","refs":[{"start":120,"end":124,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b22"},{"start":754,"end":758,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b23"},{"start":771,"end":772,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_2"},{"start":1251,"end":1255,"marker":"bibr","target":null},{"start":2061,"end":2062,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_4"}]},{"text":"The most relevant concepts of the Manifesto are the awareness that people are not only consumers of information (hence the need to draw a road which should bring to sound and trustable information) but also producers of information in the social media world, and the intersection of printed sources in the physical world with digital sources.

In fact in the Manifesto is present a disguised sequence of steps for moving from more general to more specific information resources.

On the other side, one basic argument against Open Access is precisely that full knowledge open to all is not really needed or, one could rephrase, society doesn't need it. Things are more complex, though. Open Access needs a broad scope because if it is meant only for researcherswhich is the dominant trend of todaysome mechanism internal to the research domain surely can be found to give all the researchers the access to scientific literature; but that would mean that Open is open only to those who deserve it, that knowledge is open to the knowledge workers and not to the otherssomehow a coming back to the positions of Guédon in 2001 [1].

So, being able to access, understand and (re)use information is obviously a major aim and issue for the citizens of this type of society. The above-mentioned new version of the Information Literacy definition published by CILIP [18], notwithstanding the doubts it can raise, precisely tries to map this situation where managing information in the widest sense is vital for every aspect of citizens' life. Simple words like \"managing information in the widest sense is vital\" hide one of the biggest problem of IL, that is not simply explaining/teaching how specific pieces of information must be correctly analyzed, rather teaching how to autonomously find the sources of trustable information and how to evaluate them when technical competence is needed. 5 Orto express the matter in other words -IL is not simply (must not be reduced to) a type of training to the use of 'intellectual devices' 6 : it is instead a literacy (!) which is learnt over the years as the already cited \"Promoting media and information literacy in libraries\" states: \"Ultimately, information literate people are those who have learned how to learn\".","refs":[{"start":587,"end":591,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b17"},{"start":1115,"end":1116,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_6"},{"start":1255,"end":1256,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_7"}]},{"text":"Usually when speaking of what could be the interest for citizens in Open Access first of all one thinks of medical information 7 .

All this in turn has implications for the perspectives and expectancy of life of people and for the costs the public institutions will have to pay, or not, for the present and future health of those people -at least in the European welfare.

FOSTER Plus European project [27], for example, specifically tackles this problem with its module \"Integrating Open Science in Information Literacy education\" but once more its aim are the researchers, not the society or the citizens: FOSTER aim is \"to contribute to a real and lasting shift in the behaviour of European researchers to ensure that Open Science (OS) becomes the norm\".","refs":[{"start":254,"end":258,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b24"},{"start":797,"end":801,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b25"}]},{"text":"On the problematic side, in various situations, people don't want to share data in open access because they think that they could in the future, in today unforeseeable ways, take profiteconomic, intellectual, etc.from the data they actually produced and feel as 'their own' 8 .

The high complexity of today's world has us all thinking that the production of knowledge is reserved to those who (already) knows. Undoubtedly there are real reasons to think so, but this way of thinking implies an idea of knowledge as repetition, an idea of science as walled garden. The idea of trusting those who already proved trustable. And the situation of paywall around a big part of the knowledge excludes those who work and don't study hence (apparently) have no need to intellectually progress their life. But real (radical) innovation requires at least that also new persons can 'enter the domain' that is that they can access the knowledge body actually available. The core of the concept lies in the word \"new\", new persons: that is outsiders, those who are not already part of the research domain be it academic or private. Take for example a student who has finished her/his degree programmes: as soon as s/he goes out of the academia s/he loses the legal access to the paywalled scientific publications. But probably that is the moment when s/he is more intellectually productive in an innovative way. The assumption of Information Literacy in 1974 that an improved ability of all of the citizens and workers to access sources of information of assured quality and exploit them in their activities is beneficial for the whole country and its economy could be rephrased. We could say that the human capital and the cultural capital must be preserved and fostered, and this happens if people of every type not only scientists and scholarshave continuous, abundant, free access to authoritative sources of information and knowledge.","refs":[]},{"text":"In line with these reflections Catalani [28] commenting the conference \"Sfide e alleanze tra Biblioteche e Wikipedia\", held in 2017 at the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale di Firenze, wrote: \"Progetti del genere [Wikimedia, Wikisource, Wikidata] consentono di centrare diversi obiettivi: la valorizzazione del patrimonio bibliografico, il miglioramento della qualità dell'informazione sulle piattaforme Wikimedia, il trasferimento delle conoscenze a beneficio dell'intera società civile in un'ottica di terza missione, il coinvolgimento degli studenti nel processo di costruzione del sapere a seguito dell'acquisizione di abilità di media literacy.\" The presence of \"trasferimento delle conoscenze a beneficio dell'intera società ̀civile\" is of primary relevance, obviously. 9The Need for Literacy The main, obvious objection to the above paragraphs is that \"it is not easy\", \"one needs to be an expert\", \"to do so a lot of education is necessary\". Yes, it is truesee e.g. what Lopes et al. [29], and many others, wrote 10 . And here is the point where Open Access and Information Literacy connect to each other: the flow of information is complex and to intercept it, to take profit of it, the usual literacy is not sufficient. An Information Literacy is needed. In 1974 Paul Zurkowski understood this need more clearly than today when apparently the dominating idea is that using the devices corresponds to thus being informationally and digitally literate. The phenomenon of predatory journals (publication of unevaluated research articles on pay-topublish journals) is one of the holes on the dark side of research, which shows that (more) Information Literacy is necessary also on the part of reputed scholars and scientists, as it seems if they contribute to those journals. The first organized description expression of the problem probably was the so called \"Beall list\" (https:// beallslist.weebly.com/) and the last one at the moment of writing of this paper was the article published by to investigative journalists, Langhans and Krause, on the Süddeutsche Zeitung [30] showing that unfortunately many serious scholars publish on predatory journals. The article specifically investigated these practices in the German research context but nothing allows to think that for any other country the situation would be much different. One of the focal points of the matter was expressed by a post signed by Gerd Antes, scientific director of the Cochrane Germany Foundation, commenting the Süddeutsche Zeitung article and published in the Cochrane community blog [31] 11 . He wrote that \"the technical revolutions [brought by the digital world] that have taken place allow every lay individual to put together a professional-looking journal on the Internet, in which scientists from reputable institutions may then publish their findings, without even realizing what they are getting into\". If it is sufficient for a journal to be \"professional looking\" for a scholar to judge it suitable to publish there, then a lot of education into Information Literacy is necessary also for those who could be deemed already fully literate.","refs":[{"start":40,"end":44,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b26"},{"start":772,"end":773,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_10"},{"start":988,"end":992,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b27"},{"start":1017,"end":1019,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_11"},{"start":2073,"end":2077,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b28"},{"start":2565,"end":2569,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b29"},{"start":2570,"end":2572,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_12"}]}]},{"title":"Once More, Digital Libraries","paragraphs":[{"text":"The most radical difference between the times of Zurkowski and ours is the digital world: while information continues to be abundant in the physical world (mainly in the form of print) its part present in the digital world is much more manageable and easily reachable but requires new perspectives, new abilities, new competence. In fact, it is today that the ideas of Zurkowski become really capable to change the reality. Antes comments instead that \"this development [the spread of predatory journals] is one of the systematically overlooked, undesirable side effects of the digit[al]ization movement\" as if being still at the times of Oldenburg could be better. We on the contrary think that the problems we face are those of our time -it means that there will be a lot of work for librarians to do, to bring not only to Open Access but also to Information Literacy scholars and scientists, students and citizens. And for the scientific information and knowledge the digital libraries digital continue to have a role to play.","refs":[]}]}],"tables":{},"abstract":{"title":"Abstract","paragraphs":[{"text":"The Open Access was initially (blandly) conceived in view not only of researchers but also of lay readers, then this perspective slowly faded out. The Information Literacy movement wants to teach citizens how to arrive at trustable information but the amount of paywalled knowledge is still big.
