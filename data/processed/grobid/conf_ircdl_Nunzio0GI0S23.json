In this context, free-text reporting is the de facto standard to communicate diagnoses, guiding patients' treatment, and conducting therapies. Processing high volumes of free-text reports to extract the crucial knowledge is usually performed manually. However, since reports vary widely between institutions, contain noise, and lack a standard structure, this becomes an extremely time-consuming process. To overcome this limitation, Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods become essential [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] as they empower the efficient automatic processing of thousands of reports and the extraction of relevant information for several (downstream) tasks, such as clinical note mining [10,11] and structuring [12], risk prediction [13], clinical decision support [14], and precision medicine retrieval [15].","refs":[{"start":619,"end":622,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b1"},{"start":622,"end":624,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b2"},{"start":624,"end":626,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b3"},{"start":626,"end":628,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b4"},{"start":628,"end":630,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b5"},{"start":630,"end":632,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b6"},{"start":632,"end":634,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b7"},{"start":634,"end":636,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b8"},{"start":816,"end":820,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b9"},{"start":820,"end":823,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b10"},{"start":840,"end":844,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b11"},{"start":862,"end":866,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b12"},{"start":894,"end":898,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b13"},{"start":933,"end":937,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b14"}]},{"text":"In the context of digital pathology -a field that involves the analysis of histopathology images known as Whole Slide Images (WSIs) -this work aims at proving the viability of unsupervised NLP techniques to automatically extract critical information from pathology reports and use it for different applications, such as automatic report annotation and visualization [16], as well as WSI classification [17]. To this end, we present the Semantic Knowledge Extractor Tool (SKET), an unsupervised hybrid knowledge extraction system that combines rule-based techniques with pre-trained Machine Learning (ML) models to extract knowledge from pathology reports. In recent years, NLP has shifted from using rules to ML approaches [18,9], which have the advantage of learning regularities from data and of generalizing to previously unseen patterns. Moreover, the advent of efficient Neural Language Models (NLMs) [19,20,21,22] paved the way for the pre-training era, where large NLMs trained in a self-supervised fashion on huge datasets are used to develop NLP models for a number of downstream tasks.

As neural component, SKET exploits ScispaCy models [27], which provide full NER pipelines for biomedical data, consisting of large medical vocabularies, as well as Word2Vec [19] word vectors trained on the PubMed Central Open Access Subset [28]. Regarding the integration of expert rules, SKET extends the ScispaCy pipeline with two more components: Entity Fusion and Negation Detection. For Entity Fusion, SKET exploits expert rules to identify and merge specific mentions that would otherwise be regarded as separate by ScispaCy. For example, \"high-grade\" and \"dysplasia\" are considered as separate mentions, whereas we are interested in \"high-grade dysplasia\" as a unique mention. Hence, we developed regular expressions capable of identifying trigger terms that are indicative of a set of mentions that should potentially be combined into one. These expert rules have been developed on a holdout dataset, which is available in the SKET GitHub repository2 . The dataset consists of 50 diagnostic reports for each use-case and medical center, for a total of 250 diagnostic reports. For Negation Detection, SKET relies on NegEx [29], a negation detection algorithm that evaluates whether extracted entities are negated within text. NegEx uses regular expressions to identify the scope of trigger terms that are indicative of negation. Then, the entities extracted within the scope of a trigger term are marked as negated and removed.","refs":[{"start":135,"end":139,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b26"},{"start":257,"end":261,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b18"},{"start":324,"end":328,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b27"},{"start":1041,"end":1042,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_1"},{"start":1213,"end":1217,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b28"}]}]},{"title":"Entity Linking","paragraphs":[{"text":"EL can be defined as the task of assigning unique meanings to entities mentioned within text.

Given an extracted entity, SKET performs a two-stage matching approach. First, the system tries to link the entity using ad-hoc matching. Then, if ad-hoc matching fails, it employs the similarity-based matching. For Ad-Hoc Matching, SKET employs regular expressions to find trigger terms indicative of a specific concept in the ontology. Once a trigger is found, the system matches the entity containing the trigger term with the closest ontology concept. In this case, if an extracted entity contains the (trigger) term \"carcinoma\", then SKET links the entity to the \"colon adenocarcinoma\" concept. Ad-hoc matching rules have also been developed on the holdout dataset and are available on GitHub. Regarding Similarity Matching, SKET combines string and semantic matching techniques. For string matching, SKET adopts the Gestalt Pattern Matching (GPM) algorithm [30]. For semantic matching, SKET exploits the word vectors provided by ScispaCy models [27].

Datasets: For Task 1, we use 1,250 annotated reports coming from both medical centers and related to all the three use-cases. For Task 2, we resort on 9,798 annotated reports, divided among medical centers and use-cases. We refer the reader to the original publication [1] for a comprehensive description of the available data. Baselines: For both tasks, we compare SKET with two unsupervised approaches based on Bio FastText [20,34] and BioClinical BERT [22,35]. For a fair comparison, both approaches adopt the same NER ScispaCy pipeline used by SKET, but without the extensions introduced with it.

Regarding accuracy, its performance varies depending on the use-case -with the lowest score obtained in colon cancer with a value of 0.6280. As for the comparison of SKET with the considered baselines, we see that it outperforms them in each use-case for all measures. This result shows the effectiveness of combining ad-hoc, expert rules with ML models -making SKET both precise and sensitive. Specifically, ad hoc matching makes SKET precise, while semantic matching makes it sensitive. To support this intuition, we observe that unsupervised baselines -which only rely on ML models and semantic matching -have low accuracy values. Since we tackle the entity linking task as a multi-label classification problem, we resort on subset accuracy, where the set of concepts predicted for a report must exactly match the corresponding set of ground-truth concepts. Therefore, accuracy values are prone to rapidly decrease and less precise models are naturally affected by this. For text classification (Task 2), we see that SKET performs well on colon and lung cancer use-cases, whereas it shows lower accuracy values on cervix cancer. This result suggests that the cervix use-case is harder than the others, as subset accuracy drops fast when a model fails to predict all labels correctly. The higher values for micro-and weighted-average F1 -which do not perform exact match between predicted and ground-truth labels -further support this intuition. Compared to baselines, SKET outperforms them in colon and cervix use-cases. On the other hand, the BERT-based approach proves more effective in lung cancer. Despite this, the robustness of SKET across different use-cases makes it a viable solution in real scenarios, where annotated data are hard and expensive to get.","refs":[]}]},{"title":"Conclusion","paragraphs":[{"text":"In this work, we presented SKET, an unsupervised hybrid knowledge extraction system that combines rule-based techniques with pre-trained ML models to extract relevant concepts from diagnostic reports.

These data include diagnoses, which are often reported as free text, thus encoding medical knowledge that is still largely unexploited. To decode the medical knowledge present within reports, we propose the Semantic Knowledge Extractor Tool (SKET), an unsupervised knowledge extraction system combining a rule-based expert system with pretrained Machine Learning (ML) models. This work demonstrates the viability of unsupervised Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract critical information from cancer reports, opening opportunities such as data mining for knowledge extraction purposes, precision medicine applications, structured report creation, and multimodal learning.","refs":[]}]}}
