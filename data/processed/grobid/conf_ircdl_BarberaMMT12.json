Let's only think about the different meanings that the term bibliography can assume when used with different prefixes such as 'analytic' or 'descriptive'. This same loss has been denounced by Vannevar Bush [2] and therefore his vision of the Memex was a possible solution for this situation. It is therefore quite a paradox that in digital information systems and frameworks published on the World Wide Web, representing on one side Digital Libraries (DLs) and, on the other, Electronic or Digital Editions, this difference is, if possible, even sharper, having generated two different scholarly communities, which, even though overlapping, presents their own distinctive features.","refs":[{"start":293,"end":296,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b0"},{"start":671,"end":674,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b1"}]},{"text":"In fact, by concentrating on cataloguing and digitizing collections rather than analysing the content of individual items in a collection, the DL is mostly focused on publishing mechanisms (or to better say the dissemination ones) -an opposite extreme from the focus of electronic editions on textual encoding, in particular the one based on the TEI standard [3]. The DL, instead, is by nurture agnostic towards the contents it has to manage, since they could be very heterogeneous, preferring therefore to ignore the granularity of an encoded text, which is fundamental for an electronic edition. Moreover, a DL contains reproduction of physical objects or content born-digital, while in the current situation the primary sources upon which an electronic edition is based have an almost and exclusively analogical origin. But interaction between these two paradigms is actually taking place, even though, in a not very organized and co-ordinated way, following what clearly are physiological patterns, but in a deeper and more dynamic modality than the one allowed by the analogical dimension 1 .","refs":[{"start":359,"end":362,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b2"}]},{"text":"The electronic edition and the DL are modelled on the needs, experiences and uses of two different communities, even though related, and this is a natural expectation.

On one side the electronic editions and archives are expanding, becoming more and more complex and stratified, while on the other side DLs are becoming more and more granular (together with their natural tendency for progressive growth). In fact, of the two currently available formal models for DLs, the 5S [7] and the DELOS Reference Model [8], the former, being directly based on first-order logic, is granular and expressive enough to model also electronic editions, both the textual encoding level and the very different relationships existing between the witnesses which made up the textual tradition.","refs":[{"start":694,"end":697,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b7"},{"start":728,"end":731,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b8"}]},{"text":"Building on the facts presented until now, the most logical consequence is that a focus on semantic and formal models seems the only way for breaking the barriers between these DLs and electronic editions, even though, in this latter case the 1 For instance, there is the progressive adoption of IFLA FRBR model, in projects such as Perseus <http://www.perseus.tufts.edu> [4] or the Canonical Text Service protocol <http://chs75.chs.harvard.edu/projects/diginc/techpub/cts> [5] or standards such as METS.

In the context of both DLs and electronic editing, the term annotation indicates the process of adding some kind of information to an existing digital resource.

The task of librarians is to provide sets of high quality annotations for each library resource, in order to help organizing the knowledge gathered in each library. These metadata are usually designed in accordance with standard library science practices and are meant to facilitate knowledge discovery by the generic library user. A DL can be accessed by several user communities, each one with a specific vision of the world and each one interested in a specific topic or aspect of knowledge. On the contrary, built-in metadata in DLs are often generic information (e.g. year of publication, author, historical period, artistic wave, etc.), or reflects a single viewpoint.

Early implementations of manual annotation tools have been mostly developed as desktop applications or browser plugins (such as Zotero4 and others). With the growing availability of powerful client side Web programming tools and techniques, annotation tools then evolved in fully fledged Web applications such as Euro-peanaConnect Media Annotation Prototype [16] based on Annotea [17], One Click Annotator [18], the Open Knowledge Foundation's Annotator project 5 , SharedCopy6 , A.nnotate7 and many others. Another widely applied method to create annotations is to use automatic and semi-automatic tools based on euristics like natural language processing, image recognition, audio and video segmentation. For textual content there are several widespread commercial services that automatically perform a light type of annotation known as entity extraction with a constantly improving degree of relevance (e.g. Opencalais8 , Zemanta9 , AlchemyAPI10 ). While some of the existing tools address ease of use and wide adoption, they hardly provide support for expressing non trivial semantics, as establishing precise (typed) relations among digital objects or referring to specific entries in domain thesauri and vocabularies. In Semlib, the goal is to build different annotation GUIs to address different levels of expressivity, from simple tags to structured conceptual graphs, carefully balancing ease of use and expressivity. The other idea behind SemLib is that of representing annotations (simple or complex ones) in a uniform way (as RDF graphs), and expose them via REST APIs so to enable effective reuse of collaboratively created knowledge, for example to further enrich DLs.","refs":[{"start":168,"end":172,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b15"},{"start":174,"end":178,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b16"},{"start":314,"end":315,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_2"},{"start":538,"end":542,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b16"},{"start":560,"end":564,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b17"},{"start":586,"end":590,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b18"},{"start":642,"end":643,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_3"},{"start":656,"end":657,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_4"},{"start":669,"end":670,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_5"},{"start":1101,"end":1102,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_6"},{"start":1112,"end":1113,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_7"},{"start":1126,"end":1128,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_8"}]}]},{"title":"Collaborative Semantic Annotation of Texts: The SemLib Approach","paragraphs":[{"text":"One of the main goals of the SemLib project [19] is the design and implementation of a semantic aware annotation system that can be easily used in conjunction with different DLs, requiring as less modification as possible to the existing DL software infrastructures, and that can be flexible enough to address different needs of specific communities. Such differences both reside in required expressivity and complexity of annotations, which might range from simple tags to non trivial semantic relations among media content and other kind of entities, and in the use of different domain dependent terminology and vocabularies. A core requirement in SemLib is that of enabling reuse of annotations, for example to leverage them as a crowd-sourced structured knowledge that might be used to enrich DLs themselves. While interoperability at data representation level is certainly a key feature with respect to this goal, the system has to provide effective ways to meaningfully consume such data, for example allowing external applications to search annotations and to obtain \"slices\" of the overall annotations (e.g. obtaining annotations from trusted users only, or those that involves relevant resources only, etc.).","refs":[{"start":44,"end":48,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b19"}]}]},{"title":"From Tagging to Semantically Structured Annotations","paragraphs":[{"text":"The simple form of annotation, widely understood and adopted by the majority of Web users, is tagging. Keywords based tagging, however, has several disadvantages (between them: no explicit meaning and explanation; polysemy; synonymy; base form variation; specificity gap; reused in different systems). These poor semantics expressed by \"traditional\" tags prevents in fact the use of annotations to produce reusable structured knowledge, which is the core goal of SemLib. To overcome such limitations, SemLib supports \"semantic tagging\", where each tag corresponds to an entry in a controlled vocabulary or ontology and it is a Web resource in itself, thus being resolvable into a natural language description by dereferencing its URL. A similar approach has been already experimented in the Common Tag initiative (Commontag.org). The current prototype allows users to transparently search for entities (semantic tags) in Freebase.com, providing auto-complete suggestions and resulting in external web resources to be associated to text fragments or pictures in a web page. Interestingly, such web resource happens to be Linked Data sources. This means that they can be used to retrieve further information about the entities, allowing external applications, which consume such annotations, to immediately use such additional data in intelligent ways. In addition, existing APIs, such as DBPedia spotlight, are used to suggest simple forms of automatic tagging.","refs":[]},{"text":"SemLib also supports more advanced types of annotations that exploit all the expressive power of the RDF data model, which goes beyond simple semantic tagging. As an example, suppose Alice is a scholar studying Italian literature. She finds a DL with some interesting novels. While reading one of them, she highlights a paragraph and creates an annotation specifying that such a paragraph cites Alessandro Manzoni and that attempts to give a definition of \"Historical novel\". Semantic tagging as described above, does not allow to specify the relation (e.g. cites, defines) between the text and the related entities (e.g. \"Alessandro Manzoni\" and \"Historical novel\"), which is needed to answer queries like \"what are the paragraphs that cites a given author?\" or \"What definitions of historical novel does the system know?\"","refs":[]},{"text":"The SemLib annotation tool supports the creation of such complex annotations by allowing user to collect different kind of \"items\" (they can be terms from a vocabulary, web pages, or fragments of them, e.g. sentences and pictures) and then connect them via semantically typed relations, thus in fact creating a semantic graph.

In SemLib we decided to base on the Open Annotation Collaboration (OAC) data model [20]. The OAC ontology is used to represent annotations contexts, which specifies, through the oac:hasTarget property, the web resources involved in an annotation. An additional concept used in the SemLib model is that of notebook, which is an aggregation of annotations.

In the Digital Humanities community the problem is acute, partly because most of the times digital edition projects do not publish the XML annotated version of the text, but rather a derivative HTML or PDF version produced from the original XML. In these cases annotation ceases to be metadata to become part of the digital objects, thus not being reusable, preventing collaboration and further enrichments of the text. Even when the XML source files are distributed along with the human readable version, they are seldom reused or integrated outside the boundaries of the systems in which they were originated. The semantics of the annotations is in most cases based on local interpretations and local extensions of the core vocabulary. Additionally, vocabularies and thesauri are not shared and the semantics of local extensions is not machine-readable. As a result, textual resources, their interpretations and enrichments, remain siloed within the boundaries of individual projects. Data is not shared, derived information and interpretation is hidden within the browsing applications and not addressable or reusable. As a result, digital collaboration practices are rather weak if compared to other disciplines where information sharing and reuse is more common (e.g. 'hard' sciences).","refs":[{"start":176,"end":180,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b21"}]},{"text":"Stand-off semantic annotations based on the RDF standard, as described in the previous section, have the potential to overcome many of these limitations.","refs":[]},{"text":"Annotations are useful in organizing and adding information to digital content, supporting single users in studying and exploring online resources. However, a lot more value can be added if annotations are shared with others, enabling, for example, virtual communities to perform collaborative tasks. In SemLib, both annotations and vocabularies can be published on the Web in machine-readable format (RDF) so that any authorized application can interpret annotations. This basically decouples the applications used to access the DL from the content itself, allowing for multiple \"views or interpretations\" of the same content to be published in a decentralized way. Another interesting side effect of the Semantic Web approach, is that it naturally enables collaboration: as long as users have the possibility to upload their annotation somewhere on the Web, they are free to keep enriching the content stored on the DL without the need of any coordination with the content holder. Users communities can share their work by simply exchanging URLs that point to their annotation graphs. At a later stage, user annotations can also be made authoritative by the library curators, by incorporating them into the DL. Annotations are provided with provenance metadata, so that it is always possible to determine who made a specific annotation and when.","refs":[]},{"text":"While the prototype has not yet been released to the public, some online screencasts demonstrate the core functionalities and user interactions 12 .","refs":[{"start":144,"end":146,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_10"}]}]},{"title":"Adding Meaning.

A lot of these manuscripts had been identified in codices now held in various libraries in all Europe.

The first purpose is thus to create relationships between people and manuscripts related to people at some level (the copyist, the owner, the requester) and the manuscripts with the lexicon used in order to describe them; this information born naturally from the letters and have to be expressed with semantic assertions through external annotations.

The same attribute @ref was also used for the element <bibl> and <term>, with a TEI customization. The @ref value points to a specification of the item stores in a place outside the document. Therefore, within these elements, an access point is defined as an element owning a URI reference that points to @rdf:about attribute in the external repository. In this way each pertinent string of characters or fragment has an URI.","refs":[]},{"text":"If the URI pointing gives us the possibility to formally describe annotated elements in the external representation, we need a system to create connections between these annotated elements.

Starting from Vespasiano's letters it became possible to expose authority information about people, manuscripts, technical lexicon regarding XV century culture, in order to start to create an open and public authority list, to be integrated in authority records, as a set of Web resources. We need firstly to decide which kind of relevant added data it is possible to specify for each of the three categories.

Mostly we need to focus on the fact that between these concepts (persons and manuscripts; manuscripts and lexicon) we can define relationships that provide greater conceptual depth and that can be easily expressed in a formal language, creating a good model for the representation of the content of the letters: we can establish unambiguously the different relationships existing between a person, a manuscript and a term, such as a person being the owner, the copyist, or the client of a codex and this manuscript is described with a specific term (p.e. Piero de' Medici is owner of Plutarco's Vite, which are realized in \"chordovani\"). Mapping the specific created class (persons, manuscripts, lexicon and the different kind of relationships) with predicates defined in existent model a suitable ontology could be distributed. We are now analyzing different predicates for internal connection, starting from these consideration: a person could be owner-of; copyist-of; illuminator-of; requester-of a manuscript; a manuscript could be created-for; requested-by; copied-by; illuminated-by a person / described-with terms; the lexicon is related-to a manuscript. But like we explain in the previous section the external information could be linked to some external resources. We are studying some predicates. For person, TEI prosopography integrated with CIDOC-CRM 13 for relationships between Agents, Physical things, Events and Places. For manuscripts an ontology properly extending and customizing the FRBR 14 can be used to capture the subtle difference between the physical codex, the content it has and the work the codex is a manifestation-of.

Therefore both the act of annotating a text, thus giving it the status of \"scholarly\" and the addition of (meta)information to a generic resource can greatly benefit from the adoption of a common formal model, which at the same time make explicit both their actual natures and potentialities. The aim of SemLib project is to use standard technologies to create a really usable application, easy to use for every kind of user and easy to integrate in heterogeneous digital libraries, therefore filling up a current gap in the landscape of annotation applications on three different levels: actually usability, ease of use, integration. For these reasons we are organizing focus groups which would consolidate the theoretic foundations which led the implementation of the application.","refs":[]}]}],"tables":{},"abstract":{"title":"Abstract","paragraphs":[{"text":"The distinction between digital libraries and electronic editions is becoming more and more subtle.
