For example, accessibility often overlaps with open accessibility, a concept related to open access that does not find a direct acknowledgement in the FAIRness since FAIR data does not mean open data [7]. Open accessibility is linked more to the licences associated with the resources, hence to reusability, than to accessibility itself, which is defined without mentioning open access. Similarly, it is likely to see the concept of reusability intuitively associated with preservation, pursued by depositing the resources into a repository, even if the latter is not mentioned in the definition of reuse given by the principles.","refs":[{"start":314,"end":317,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b6"}]},{"text":"Privileging certain elements of FAIRness over others is another clear trend.

In fact, it is arguable that metadata enabling findability should be a subset of those contributing to the reusability of a resource and as such the minimum requirements for its description, that should be defined on a community basis. This view is based on a vision of the FAIR principles as incremental tasks mainly build upon the metadata associated with the resources. Therefore, the F2-related tools and services are not always associated also with reusability.","refs":[]},{"text":"Similarly, the distinction between tools enabling I1 and those that foster R1.3 is founded on the difference between knowledge representation languages, including their serialisations, and metadata formats.
