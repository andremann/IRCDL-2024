A single search interface is required, allowing the composition of a query formula that combining images and texts, sounds and terms, or all these together, is useful for searching very complex documents -whose informative content extends beyond all the levels of sense and meaning, where the semantic definitions do not have less importance than the contentual characteristics.","refs":[]},{"text":"In a multimedia DL, by a common MMIR search procedure, the user may start the query with the preliminary selection of a section, and of a part of it, by using appropriate text strings.

The user may proceed with browsing, by which queries can be simply sent to the system by selecting some of the retrieved objects, or by assembling or inputting from the outside example models.

The use of subjects created by the human operator can be very useful to indicate both to the user and to the system what the mathematical analyses of an example model cannot directly gather.

Accepting the integration of ontologies in MMIR systems, a certain rigor seems to be residual in these conceptual tools, which can raise again the problem of the rigidity and abstractness of the typical IR schemes. To avoid such risk, a further hypothesis can be made about combining ontologies with folksonomies, systems of free collaborative categorization of contents on the basis of labels directly assigned by end users, or \"social tagging\". These systems, proposing their function close to the controlled semantics, can enrich them of more flexibility in metadata and tags definition.
