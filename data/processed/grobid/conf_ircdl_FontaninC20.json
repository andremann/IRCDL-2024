The translation needed is not only to mediate between English and other languages, but also between the language of science and that of the humanities, to cross a chasm which has been perceived for a long time, at least since Snow defined it in his Reed Lecture [13] as a \"gulf of mutual incomprehension\". At a conference recently organised at the University \"La Sapienza\" upon the lecture's 60 th anniversary, the theme of language surfaced in the challenges of defining the object of study and communicating science. In this respect, the name of Otlet [14] and the creation of the Universal Decimal Classification were mentioned: born of the urge to supply science with a further tool for its progress, his taxonomy was meant to assign a code number to disciplines, thereby helping highlight the relations between sciences, so that new science could be developed by the observation of the same object from different points of view.

Publication formats such as books and journal articles developed into preprints and raw data; their sharing happens via social media or, alternatively, in journals, institutional repositories or large openaccess databases such as PubMed, ArXiv or the like. In any case, the language most widely used is English. PubMed homepage states that the database comprises over 30 million citations, but a language search returns over 25 million English records, whereas Chinese, Italian and Spanish score less than 400.000 records each, Russian over 600.000, French over 700.000. Open and fair data implies a cultural translation; using languages other than English, also in contexts like citizen science, will promote cultural justice across nations, ethnicities, social strata, gender, age (the elderly, for example), foster the dissemination of the results of socio-relevant research, and hamper the potential imperialism of the English language.

It was the time of Big science, the time when Wiener criticized the habit of certain classicists to freeze language in time and forbid its development into an effective tool for communicating. He pointed out that \"the Greek language of the time of Aristotle was ready to compromise with the technical jargon of a brilliant scholar, while even the English of his learned and reverend successors is not willing to compromise with the similar needs of modern speech\" [16], so English had a long way to go. Gordin seems to agree with Pullum, that \"There's nothing about English that makes it intrinsically better for science than any other language.\". He foresees that it \"could split into three languages: English, Chinese and another language, such as Spanish, Portuguese or Arabic.\" [18], yet, it is the common language now, and it \"is perfect for science: it's precise and straightforward\", says Bosch Grau [19].

Most agree that as a tool it is well developed: Chinese is a rich language, but \"it still lacks much of the vocabulary that's needed to describe physical science\", says Cheng, Physicist at Cornell University, for whom it would be difficult to give a presentation on her research topics in her native language. Elsewhere [20] she declares that it was precisely her English competence which allowed her to \"science\" her way out of her country and of a limiting social background. She remarks that a low English competence is often confused with a lack of skills or of clarity of mind, and witnesses that Chinese researchers who are not fluent in English do not feel like trying her path. The same happens for Spanish speakers, and, as Clarissa Rios Rojas underlines, that it is not just a matter of reading and writing literature in English, but of understanding the process and culture of science: this is why she founded a mentoring program, Ekpa'palek, \"that helps students from Latin America to navigate academia\" [19].

There would be much to say on these statements from an historical and social point of view, and it would be beyond our scope to go deeper, but it might be surmised at least that, at the time, the education of the average German or Japanese child was based on totally different experience. Moreover in Wiener we find the same taste of American society in the concept of information itself -\"The fate of information in the typically American world is to become something which can be bought or sold.\"and in the idea of research as Big science, when he says \"The skill by which the French and English do great amounts of work with apparatus which an American high-school teacher would scorn as a casual stick-and-string job, is not to be found among any but a vanishingly small minority of our young men.\" [16]. Wiener tells us of a society where research is supported by large funds because it is a product for the market. In fact, he laments the lack of artistic creativity and proper training in the practice of science, the subservient attitude of research to the market, and feels that big laboratories are over-structured for a future where he does not \"foresee that the next generation will be able to furnish the colossal ideas on which colossal projects naturally rest.\" [16]. Moreover he reflects the \"taste\" of a time when the scientist was male (him; young men), and American was synonymous with from the USA, when the perception in terms of gender and post-colonial had not settled yetthough even recently Isabel Allende was very surprised when an immigration clerk in the USA insisted that she should qualify herself as coloured and not American [26].","refs":[{"start":640,"end":644,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b14"},{"start":1449,"end":1453,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b14"},{"start":1923,"end":1927,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b14"},{"start":2303,"end":2307,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b23"}]},{"text":"In a world of Big data we need all the different perspectives that we can use.

The traditional mission of the librarian transposed into the digital environment implies collection curation, organization and access to materials for the specific communities served. The role of a librarian within an academic organization or a research team is exemplified by the experience of Luisella Goldschmidt-Clermont, who was for ten years Senior Scientific Information Officer at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) within the community of high-energy physicists [28]. She remarked that scientists, absorbed by their research duties, struggled to keep up with literature updates and with external communication of their results and suggested that some members on the research team should be specifically in charge of that. Differences are perceivable between scientist and humanist: Goldschmidt-Clermont observes that physicists are not keen on allocating more funding and staff to information management and communication.

The right attitude, therefore, might be to raise awareness on the fact that English is a tool for communicating, while bearing in mind the value of vernacular, local literature. Librarians, who manage collections by standards, languages of their own, could help communicate internationally the products of research in local languages and the cultural diversity they represent. Moreover, learning a language is not about finding different labels for the same boxes, as in different contexts it is the boxes and their contents that change. Learning technical English and discussing the terminology for library services in another language \"enhances the librarians' perception about their role\" and helps them remain \"inventive and creative to match the transformations in the nature of information and society.\" [33], states Fontanin, who has been teaching English to librarians for the past twenty years.
