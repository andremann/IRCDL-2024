For decades, DL programmers, librarians, systems specialists, users, scientists, researchers, and institutions have already been working collaboratively to build, innovate and sustain DLs. Specifically, conducting SI research means a shift to reframe the focus on understanding \"the interdisciplinary study of the design, uses and consequences of information technologies that take into account their interaction with institutional and cultural contexts\" [10]. SI researchers hold several premises. First, CTs and the social and organizational settings in which they are embedded are in a relationship of mutual shaping [10]. Second, their analyses frequently challenge commonly-held assumptions about information technologies, and often attempt to improve the lives of the people who work and play with ICTs [10]. Designed to provide a specific tool for understanding socio-technical systems in a way that advantages neither the social nor the technical aspects of a system, the STIN strategy was proposed as a framework for SI analysis [413]. In the early 2000s STIN was used to examine topics in which we are concerned with today DLs and the advancement of open; scholarly communication forums [ibid], democratization of scholarly publishing [12], web information systems [13], online communities [14], and DLs [15].","refs":[{"start":168,"end":171,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b8"},{"start":628,"end":632,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b9"},{"start":793,"end":797,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b9"},{"start":982,"end":986,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b9"},{"start":1211,"end":1216,"marker":"bibr","target":null},{"start":1418,"end":1422,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b11"},{"start":1448,"end":1452,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b12"},{"start":1473,"end":1477,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b13"},{"start":1487,"end":1491,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b14"}]},{"text":"The most extensive study was conducted by Kling et al. in 2003 [9], where they conducted one of the most extensive analysis using their STIN strategy.

By building a standard model, researchers can incorporate conceptions that are incomplete or left out of the standard models. \"What is left out of the standard models are important features of very specific technologies and settings in which people try to use them, the organizational complexity in which IT-based services are provided and embedded\" [11: 49].
