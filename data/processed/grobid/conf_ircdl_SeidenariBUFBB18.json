Several approaches resorted to computer vision systems to offer recommendation based on passive external behaviour observation [2] or, more recently, to develop a wearable smart audio guide [3] to automatically play content or interact with artworks [4]. These modern approaches work by constantly matching the user point of view with a visual database of the known artworks, deciding, depending on user behavior, whether to start or not the audio description generated by means of text to speech technology [3] or to show additional content on gestures [4]. Although designed to work in different settings, they all require a computer vision expert to train and test a computer vision models for artworks, person or statues.

Analyzing and predicting the behavioral patterns of museum visitors, through the use of interactive digital guides was proposed in [7,8].

Moreover, since we are dealing with a sequence of frames, in order to improve artwork recognition we take advantage from temporal coherence to make the output more stable. Our method is based on [3], which we briefly cover in the following. We use YOLO [11] network that has the main advantage of processing each frame just once to locate all the objects of interest yielding accurate results even for moderate size networks. The architecture is derived from Tiny Net, a small CNN pre-trained on ImageNet, which allows the application to run at 10 FPS and fitting on the memory of a Shield Tablet. The system was fine-tuned to recognize artworks and people using our dataset. Recognizing people is relevant for two reasons: first we can exploit the presence of people in the field of view to create a better understanding of context; secondly, without learning a person model it is hard to avoid false positives on people, since artwork training data contains statues which may picture human figures. Learning jointly a person and an artwork model, the network features can be trained to discriminate between this two classes.","refs":[{"start":573,"end":576,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b2"},{"start":631,"end":635,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b10"}]}]},{"title":"Artwork Recognition","paragraphs":[{"text":"The rich features computed by the convolutional layers are exploited and reused to compute an object descriptor for artwork recognition.
