For example, physics and medical science communities are not only interested in the data resulting from their experiments, but also in: (i) the origin of the data, i.e. the physical or virtual location where it was originally produced, or (ii) in the descendant line of the data, i.e. the sequence of actions that followed its production and determined its transformation in a sequence of intermediate digital manifestations.","refs":[{"start":142,"end":159,"marker":"bibr","target":null}]},{"text":"Lately, provenance has become increasingly important for Digital Libraries (DLs). DLs, which started out as a digital replicate of traditional libraries, have witnessed a rapid evolution in the last two decades. In particular, content is no longer limited to digital text documents described by bibliographic metadata records and functionality not restricted to ingestion and metadata-based search of such objects. DLs today handle socalled information objects [9], intended as digital objects of any file format associated to metadata records of different kinds (e.g. geo-spatial information, licensing) and to other objects, to form graphs of arbitrary complexity. Similarly, functionality is richer and much more complex than in the past, in order to cope with such graph-oriented data models and variety of application domains. Due to their cross-domain nature, DLs numbered among the challenges that of introducing ways for keeping track of provenance of information objects and offering functionality to exploit at best such information.","refs":[{"start":461,"end":464,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b8"}]},{"text":"Provenance has been studied extensively by the e-Science community where several models have been proposed [18,20] to capture the notion of provenance of objects generated by scientific workflows. A scientific workflow consists of a set of orchestrated processes generating output objects from a set of input objects. In these applicative scenarios provenance is typically recorded at the time at which the workflow is executed and output objects are typically \"versioned\" and not \"modified\" by the workflows. However, the life-cycle of DL information objects differs from e-Science's and such models can hardly be adopted in this context.

In this paper we intend to address this issue and propose a novel model for DL provenance based on the notion of event. Unlike other provenance models [18,16], which capture the notion of causality between different objects of interest, our model claims that the provenance of an object is described by its history, expressed as the sequence of events happened to the object since its birth. The objective of the model is two-fold: providing guidelines and best practices for DL designers and developers to deal with provenance for DLs and, at the same time, facilitating DL systems interoperability on that respect. Moreover, the model mitigates the long-standing granularity problem [7], in which the expressiveness of a provenance model is constrained by the granularity level of objects.","refs":[{"start":602,"end":606,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b16"},{"start":606,"end":609,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b14"},{"start":1136,"end":1139,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b6"}]},{"text":"The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes our provenance model, while Section 3 introduces a case study to exemplify the usage of the model and show how it can tackle the granularity problem.

D4Science (DIstributed colLaboratories Infrastructure on Grid ENabled Technology 4 Science -Jan 2008-Dec 2009) is a project co-funded by European Commissions Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development. Its major outcome is a production e-Infrastructure enabling on-demand resource sharing across organizations boundaries. Through its capabilities this e-Infrastructure accelerates multidisciplinary research by overcoming barriers related to heterogeneity (especially related to access to shared content), sustainability and scalability. In the context of D4Science, content can be of very heterogeneous nature, ranging from textual and multimedia documents to experimental and sensor data, to images and other products generated by elaborating existing data, to compound objects made of heterogeneous parts. The D4Science e-infrastructure also supports the notion of Virtual Research Environments (VREs), i.e. integrated environments providing seamless access to the needed resources as well as facilities for communication, collaboration and any kind of interaction among scientists and researchers. VREs are built by dynamically aggregating the needed constituents, i.e data collection, services and computing resources, after on-demand hiring them through the e-Infrastructure [3]. A D4Science VRE offers a virtual view of an information space populated by objects that can be composed by different parts, each of which can be derived through specialized elaborations from different heterogeneous sources. If the D4Science supported flexibility for sharing and re-using provides a great potentiality to VRE users, it also largely increases the importance of all the requirements that motivate the need for provenance information, i.e. authenticity and data quality, reproducibility, policies management, etc. Moreover, it also makes particularly challenging the association of provenance information with the information objects and their parts.","refs":[{"start":111,"end":114,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b2"},{"start":1425,"end":1428,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b2"}]},{"text":"One of the VREs that are currently supported by the D4Science Infrastructure is AquaMaps [2].

Fish occurrence data are collected from a number of sources such as OBIS [5] and GBIF [4], these sources may in turn be aggregators that harvest data from other sources.

Each prediction map is composed of half-degree cells. The prediction map of a half-degree cell indicates the probability of occurrence of a certain species in that location. One provenance query is to find out why we get a certain value for a particular half-degree cell. The main difficulty of such query arises from the socalled \"granularity problem\". Previous research efforts in provenance have recognized this problem and attempted [11] to enforce a single granularity level. However, the end result was either a too coarse grain model that does not capture enough information or a too fine grain model that is too laborious to maintain. Most importantly, in order to match the granularity of processes to that of objects, we would need to introduce counterintuitive fictitious processes. Instead, in our model, modifications to tables and tuples can be modeled as events at their native granularity, i.e. , if a process is applied to a table, then it is modeled as an event that takes a table as input.","refs":[{"start":182,"end":185,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b4"},{"start":195,"end":198,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b3"},{"start":324,"end":327,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b0"},{"start":887,"end":891,"marker":"bibr","target":null}]},{"text":"The following example queries are written in set notation.

We assume that all the data objects are brought into the system by an event of type 'create' and that event is controlledBy its data provider. Listing 2 shows how the contributors to the information object Salmon can be computed. The first 5 lines are identical as those in Listing 1. Line 6 defines a set 'contributing events' of event types whose values are assumed to come from a controlled vocabulary. An agent of an event whose type is in 'contributing events' is considered to be a contributor.

By leaving the decision on when to generate provenance trails exogenous to the model, it is possible to make time-space trade-offs on a per-application basis, for example, we can pre-compute and cache provenance trails for a certain set of objects.","refs":[{"start":94,"end":98,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b10"}]}]},{"title":"Conclusions and Future Work","paragraphs":[{"text":"Digital Libraries rapidly evolved in the last decades to become today advanced systems for the integration and management of cross-domain digital objects. As such, keeping track of provenance information of the objects of a digital library, possibly operated over, imported and controlled by different agents through differently trustable processes, becomes a crucial issue for the users of such systems. On the other hand, existing solutions typically address problem-specific provenance requirements and do not follow a general-purpose modeling approach. In this paper we proposed an eventbased provenance model for digital libraries, inspired by well-known provenance models in the field of e-Science and cultural heritage. Driven by acquired experiences in such fields, we considered a number of digital library real-case scenarios and defined a provenance model which captures what we believe are the essential aspects for describing the provenance of digital library information objects.","refs":[]},{"text":"In the future we plan to implement a provenance service, devised to be easily integrated in any digital library system to offer support for provenance management based on our event model.

In the last decade, keeping track of provenance has become crucial for the correct exploitation of data in a wide variety of application domains. The rapid evolution of digital libraries, which have become today advanced systems for the integration and management of cross-domain digital objects, recently called for models capturing the aspects of data provenance in this application field. However, there is no common definition of digital library provenance and existing solutions address the problem only from the perspective of specific application scenarios. In this paper we propose a provenance model for digital libraries, inspired by approaches and experiences in the e-Science and cultural heritage worlds and based on the notion of event occurred to an object. The model aims at capturing the specificities of provenance for digital libraries objects in order to provide practitioners and researchers in the field with common DL-specific provenance description languages.","refs":[]}]}}
