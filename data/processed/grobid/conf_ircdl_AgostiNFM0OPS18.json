The CULTURA consortium had a strong emphasis on meeting real end-user needs, maximizing societal impact and laying a foundation for successful commercialization. To this end, the environment went beyond the traditional search-based exploration, providing natural language processing technologies, entity-oriented search and a comprehensive set of logging, bookmarking and annotating tools that make it a powerful aid to both extensive and intensive work on content collections. For the validation of the project, two pre-existing cultural heritage collections were used: The 1641 Depositions, a collection of accounts by victims of the Irish Rebellion of 1641, which constitutes a textual corpus that has been augmented by manually generated metadata2 ; and IPSA, a collection of illuminated scientific manuscripts (including herbals and astronomical-astrological codices), which is a purely visual collection with extensive metadata3 .","refs":[{"start":1093,"end":1094,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_0"},{"start":1276,"end":1277,"marker":null,"target":"#foot_1"}]}]},{"title":"Narratives","paragraphs":[{"text":"Narratives have been introduced in the CULTURA environment as a novel tool to engage the different types of users [10]. Narratives are implemented as threads through the document collection, linking artifacts and tools related to a particular topic. Expert researchers, guided by the use cases and user requirements outlined during user consultations, designed narratives. They used their specialist knowledge of the collections to create a series of paths through the content that can engage users from all the groups in the exploration and use of specific content. To address the different level of expertise of each category of users, each narrative has a number of levels. Less expert users are offered a relatively high level narrative, but as users interact with the resources that are presented to them, the system dynamically discloses additional material, resulting in a more complex and more captivating user experience. These narratives allow for an open-ended and developing engagement with the resource collections. An example of a high level narrative are the ones designed for less expert users. These describe the different steps of a short course on a specific topic that is encompassed within the collection. Typically, the relevant material will be spread across the diverse parts of the different components of a collection.

In the case of the historical textual corpus, a series of narratives were developed for use with secondary school students who were encountering the collection for the first time. These users were presented with a sidebar containing a brief explanation of the context of the individual part of the text being viewed, along with prompts for further research. Users can move backwards or forwards within the narrative, or branch off into further narratives, covering particular areas that especially pique their interest. At any point, the user can leave the pathway to carry out their own detailed investigations. Users are able to resume the narrative when desired. In addition to tying together chains of documents, these narratives can include the other tools that contribute to the environment. For instance, a user of the IPSA collection who is following a narrative based on herbals of a given historical period can be presented with the results of a faceted search based on chronology and title (see Fig. 1a) or a user who is following a narrative based on a particular location can be presented with the results of an entity-oriented search displaying the relationship of the entity in question to other entities within the collection (see Fig. 1b). The visualization features are also available to users of the textual collection, and, in a similar way, allow the collection to be explored on the basis of the links and relationships between people, places and events.

In this analysis, we used heuristics to identify users and, as a result, we suggested that authentication would be required since it would allow TEL servers to identify users and create profiles to tailor specific needs. Moreover, authentication would have also helped to solve the problem concerning crawlers accesses, granting access to some sections of the Web site only to registered users, blocking crawlers using faked user agents. A second batch of seven months of TEL Web log files, from October 1st 2006 to April 30th 2007, was analyzed in [1]. This new set of log files contained richer information about: the Internet Protocol (IP) address and the user-agent which allowed the identification of single users, as well as the referrer field, a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) address which communicates the last page viewed by the user which could be used to know the way visitors get to TEL service. These logs also contained the information saved by the cookie file such as: the language selected by the user during the navigation of the service; the collections of documents selected during the query or query refinement, the identifier of the session assigned by the server to a specific user. These richer data allowed us to better understand the profile of the TEL users in terms of geographical areas, willingness to spend some time to perform advanced searches and to select collections of documents different from the default ones. Further analysis to combine the results of the HTTP logs analysis with that of the user study to give a better understanding on the usage of The European Library service were presented in [3,6]. In this work, a user study was conducted in order to collect into HTTP logs enough data to study the browsing activity and analyze possible relations between explicit preferences collected by online questionnaires and implicit actions recorded in the logs. One interesting finding of this implicit and explicit data analysis was that short sessions found in the HTTP logs could be explained by the answers collected by questionnaires during user studies; in particular, users were not satisfied by the presentation of the results and by the content of the results. The sources of data used and the interrelation among them are depicted in Fig. 4 where an example of a user session is drawn. Implicit data on user interaction with a new Digital Library portal were useful for detecting typical usage patterns of different user groups, as well as their possible evolution or stability over time. They provided key information for identifying possible interaction problems on a large-scale (e.g. the whole user population), but little or no insight as to why these problems occurred and how they could be solved, as discussed in [5]. They undoubtedly were influential in the design of more focused survey studies (based on explicit user data) able to investigate which relevant user expectations, habits, motivations, preferences or difficulties were responsible for the interaction patterns observed. Some of the insights gathered in these surveys were used as requirements for the design of an advanced query suggestion tool focussed on and tailored to TEL named i-TEL-u.  While traditional query suggestion tools could not recognize different contexts from which the suggested queries are produced, i-TEL-u leveraged a variety of data sources and allowed users to seamlessly move from one context to another according to their evolving information needs during the search session [2].","refs":[{"start":735,"end":738,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b0"},{"start":1823,"end":1826,"marker":"bibr","target":null},{"start":1826,"end":1828,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b6"},{"start":2474,"end":2475,"marker":"figure","target":"#fig_3"},{"start":2956,"end":2959,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b5"}]}]},{"title":"Multilingual Log Analysis -LogCLEF","paragraphs":[{"text":"Despite being a very important resource to study user information needs and preferences, very few log datasets have been made available for research experiments.

Web search [15], biomedical search [30], patent retrieval [26], and enterprise search [13], as well as DL, started to rely on Information Retrieval Systems (IRS) to perform automatic indexing and searching. However, with Internet becoming pervasive and accessible to everyone, IRS have begun to exploit more and more complex techniques to satisfy the user information need. Among them, particularly advantageous was the use of click log data to adapt systems to users behaviour. Nowadays, it is a pretty common practice for commercial search engines, to record user interactions with their interface, such as query keywords, clicked URLs, impressions and clicks timestamps and many others. Click log data offer several advantages [22]: they are easy and inexpensive to collect, they are available in real time and they are user centered, i.e. they directly represent user preferences. However, even if click data have proven to be a valuable resource of implicit feedback, they are biased and noisy and they are intrinsically difficult to interpret [21]. Moreover, the user behaviour is tightly related to the information need and task that she is performing. As an example, consider that solely in Web search user queries can be classified as navigational, when the user searches for a particular website that she has in mind, and Informational, when the user explores the result page looking for some information on a specific topic [11]. When the scope is widened and heterogeneous tasks are considered, then the differences in user behaviour will be even more pronounced, as presented in [31] where Web, job and talent search are compared. In [31] a thorough analysis of log data is conducted, showing that substantial differences in Web, job and talent search can be detected, when considering the click frequency for each rank position, query frequency and query diversity.","refs":[{"start":221,"end":225,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b15"},{"start":245,"end":249,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b30"},{"start":268,"end":272,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b26"},{"start":296,"end":300,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b13"},{"start":940,"end":944,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b22"},{"start":1259,"end":1263,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b21"},{"start":1645,"end":1649,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b11"},{"start":1802,"end":1806,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b31"},{"start":1857,"end":1861,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b31"}]},{"text":"The heterogeneity of tasks, information needs and users require IRS to adjust their output by considering the context in which the search is performed.

Differently from other state of the art models [14,29], the exploitation of Markov chains makes it possible to describe a user who scans the ranked list of documents according to possibly complex paths.
