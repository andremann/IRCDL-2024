Generally, most of -Like type elements can peacefully be converted into OWL classes: this entails that an \"automatic\" transformation is allowed here for the formalization of such entities. E. g. elements of TEI Model Class model.persEventLikebirth, death, event, listEventcan be transformed in OWL classes with the same name. However they have to be reanalysed in iterative controls for a correct hierarchical characterization without redundancy, wrong or badly conceptualization, following OntoClean methodology [14] as a correct way for creation of a taxonomy. E.g. considering previous example, listEvent have to be deleted as a wrong, unnecessary entity; birth and death have to be correctly declared in taxonomy as kind of events. Indeed, here \"automatic\" doesn't mean strictly automated, because a general rule for such transformation is unpredictable. Furthermore, we noted that transformation of elements members of-Like type Classes into OWL Classes is not generalizable when these ones are also member of TEI Model Class of type-Part. When this situation occurs, in most cases-Like type elements, and also-Part type elements, can be converted in object and data properties. E.g. model.nameLike elementslike name, orgName, persNamewhen members of model.addrPart, can better be converted into data properties. â€¢ Generalization on elements of-Att type Model Classes: these ones are also converted into OWL classes, restricting in an iterative way the scope of elements to be transformed, but neither here a right generalization is possible. â€¢ Generalization on attributes: these ones can be converted into OWL datatype properties, whose domain is the union of all Classes (derived from TEI Model Classes) they apply to, and whose range is the datatype assigned to each of them in the XML Schema. However, they also have to be revised in order to define which attributes point to \"real\" entities and then have to be declared as object properties (e.g. @who attribute, a pointer to a person reference; @source attribute, a pointer to a bibliographical source).","refs":[{"start":572,"end":576,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b13"}]},{"text":"This basic set of rules does not cope with the modeling into OWL of structural XML content models, for which a mix of OWL objectProperties and restrictions can be used as proposed in [15].

As we said above, a particularly relevant aspect of the conceptual model definition process will be the check of the existing ontologies in order to ensure maximum portability in all contexts, in a hybrid approach to ontology development. The TEI ontologies Special Interest Group has already done some relevant work in this area, especially thanks to the work of Ore and Eide with CIDOC-CRM [18]. However, beside the most common existent ontologies devoted e.g. to cultural heritage (CIDOC-CRM also in FRBRoo version 5 ), archives (EAD 6 and EAC-CPF 7 ), metadata exposure (DC 8 and DC terms 9 ), other ontologies, developed in other different domains, provide new form of conceptualization. For example, ontologies as FABIO and CITO could be an interesting application case [19]. FABIO is based on the FRBR approach to the document as a complex entity. The stratification of the levels of analyis, as we said above, enrich the description of cultural entities.
