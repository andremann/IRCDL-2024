Therefore, annotations have been adopted in a variety of different contexts, such as content enrichment, data curation, collaborative and learning applications, and social networks, as well as in various information management systems, such as the Web (semantic and not), digital libraries, and databases. The role of annotations in digital humanities is well known and documented [1][2][3][4][5][6].

In turn, each sign is characterized by one or more meanings of annotation, which specify the semantics of the sign; for example, we can have a sign whose meaning corresponds to the title field in the Dublin Core (DC) metadata schema, in the case of a metadata annotation, or we can have a sign carrying a question of the author's about a document whose meaning may be \"question\" or similar.","refs":[]},{"text":"An annotation has a scope which defines its visibility (public, shared, or private), and can be shared with different groups of users.

These two different types searches may need to be merged together in a query if, for example, the user wants to retrieve annotations by a given author about a given topic; this could be expressed by a boolean AND query which specifies both the author (structured part) and the content (unstructured part) of the annotations to be searched. Nevertheless, boolean searches are best suited for dealing with exact match searches and they need to be somewhat extended to also deal with best match searches. Therefore, we need to envision a search strategy able to express complex conditions that involve both exact and best match searches. The \"P-norm\" extended boolean model proposed by [12] is capable of dealing with and mixing both exact and best match queries, since it is an intermediate between the traditional boolean way of processing queries and the vector space processing model. Indeed, on the one hand, the P-norm model preserves the query structure inherent in the traditional boolean model by distinguishing among different boolean operators (and, or, not); on the other hand, it allows us to retrieve items that would not be retrieved by the traditional boolean model due to its strictness, and to rank them in decreasing order of querydocument similarity. Moreover, the P-norm model is able to express queries that range from pure boolean queries to pure vector-space queries, thus offering great flexibility to the user.","refs":[{"start":118,"end":119,"marker":"figure","target":null},{"start":1621,"end":1625,"marker":"bibr","target":"#b11"}]},{"text":"The hypertext that connects documents to annotations calls for a search strategy that takes it into consideration and allows us to modify the score of annotations and/or documents according to the paths in the hypertext.

Moreover, as far as the FAST RESTful Web Application is concerned, it captures also the HTTP logs and represents them according to the W3C Extended Log File Format [15]. Furthermore, the log events can be accessed and searched interactively by means of (possibly) complex extended Boolean queries, comprising both exact and best match clauses, giving thus the possibility to mine and fully exploit them; ï§ access control infrastructure: takes care of monitoring the access to the various resources and functionalities offered by the system. On the basis of the requested operation, it performs: (i) authentication, i.e. it asks for the user credentials before allowing to perform an operation; (ii) authorization, i.e. it verifies that the user currently logged in holds sufficient rights to perform the requested operation; The access control policies can be dynamically configured and changed over the time by defining roles, i.e. groups of users, entitled to perform given operations. This allows institutions to define and put in place their own rules in a flexible way according to their internal organization and working practices. Moreover, the access control infrastructure provides fine-grained control over the access to the specific resources, based on the permission granted to the resources, e.g. only the owner of a private resource and read it, even if the reading of that resource is granted to all roles; ï§ provenance infrastructure: keeps fine trace, for each resource managed by the system, of its full lineage since its first creation, allowing us to reconstruct its fully history and modifications over the time. Provenance events are statements about a resource the form: <when> <who> <predicate> <what> <why> where <when> is the time stamp at which the event occurred; <who> is the user who caused the event; <predicate> is the action carried out in the event, i.e. CREATED, READ, or DELETED; <what> is the resource originated by the event, i.e. a dump of the actual content of the resource; and <why> is the motivation that originated the event, i.e. the operation performed by the system that led to a modification of the resource.

For example, in the process of annotating a text object, the location of the text in the document must be recorded in a cross platform manner. In order to do this, a representation of the highlighted range is generated using rangy. This is a purely virtual range which means it is slightly slower than using the browser's range, but it has the advantage of being cross platform. Using a modified version of the Okfn path finder, the logic then computes a serialized path to the selected location represented by rangy which can be stored as a pointer in FAST.

This is to minimize the amount of data that a user must send and receive to and from the server. For example, details such as namespaces are added on the back end rather than on the front end (and thus are managed by the site administrator). Furthermore, when managing details such as groups, the user's permissions are derived from the verbose annotation description on the server and then passed as a single value in the simplified representation.","refs":[]}]},{"title":"Fig. 4. Architecture of the CAT annotation tool","paragraphs":[{"text":"The Drupal 7 module on the back end acts as a relay between FAST and the user. Requests for annotation creation, deletion, download etc. are passed from the front end to a request handler function on the back end. This callback function structures the data sent by the front end so that it conforms to the FAST schema and then generates the HTTP packets to be transferred. There is some logic applied at this point to determine which packets need to be sent and in what order for the request to be fulfilled. Once the system is ready, the packets are sent on to FAST. The Drupal module then waits for a response from the remote service. When one is received, the result is returned to the front end via the same callback function through which the request was initially made.","refs":[]},{"text":"The choice of a Drupal module as a means of implementation means that adding FAST-CAT to any site using the Drupal CMS should be a very simple process. Additionally, as the Drupal module is only acting as a relay, it should be a relatively simple process to swap out the back end for a more server agnostic implementation, allowing FAST-CAT to be deployed on any website, rather than only those using the Drupal 7 content management system.","refs":[]},{"text":"Certain such as creating and viewing annotations require user authentication by FAST. As FAST is a stand-alone service, it maintains its own record of user accounts and login details.

CAT performs this registration automatically.","refs":[]}]},{"title":"5","paragraphs":[{"text":"The CULTURA Environment CULTURA7 is a three year, FP7 funded project, scheduled to finish in February 2014.

FAST-CAT has been integrated into the environment in order to provide users with an additional means of interacting with the portal, as well as to provide some feedback for CULTURA's user model regarding a user's interests.

It is expected that this script will be developed and provided with future versions of FAST-CAT so as to increase the range of portals to which it may be applied Further to this, another part of the future development of FAST-CAT will be focused on improving the user's experience. It is intended that the tool be as intuitive and easy to use as possible. How this will be achieved is to be this based on the feedback given by the user groups during the CULTURA trials.","refs":[]}]}],"tables":{},"abstract":{"title":"Abstract","paragraphs":[{"text":"This paper describes the innovative annotation facilities of the CULTURA portal for digital humaties, which are aimed at improving the interaction of non specialist users and general public with cultural heritage contents.
