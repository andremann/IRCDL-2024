In this case, there will be 3 neurons in the input layer of the ANN, which represent: (i) age, (ii) device type and (iii) Web use.

The values of the weights and biases are changed in that way to minimise the overall error. The neural networks are usually trained to provide targeted outputs for specific inputs.
