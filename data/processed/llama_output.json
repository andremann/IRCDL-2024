However, there is no evidence that serious games improve learning as this is often superficially evaluated. The purpose of the paper is to understand how to improve the assessment of learning obtained with serious games. The NAVIGATE Project interdisciplinary team has tried to collaborate with university teachers to integrate the pedagogical aspect, the content aspect, and the technological aspect and has produced two serious games named 'The Navigator' and 'The Information Trap Manager' that are described in their characteristics and limits. The paper also presents further research directions aimed at using Data Analytics to improve the effectiveness of game-based learning.
