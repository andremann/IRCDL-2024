large collections of documents require a huge amount of human work to annotate documents and extract important information. In the last thirty years, the community of Document Analysis and Recognition (DAR) tried to overcome this challenge, exploiting suitable algorithms and artificial intelligence techniques to automatize the analysis of documents and reduce its costs. Among others, Document Classification (DC), Layout Analysis (DLA), and Table Understanding (TU) more broadly attracted the interest of researchers and companies. DC is the first step of many DAR pipelines, since different kinds of documents require different strategies: given a document, either scanned or digital-born, the aim is to classify it into a specific category, e.g. invoice or magazine. DLA [1] aims at recognizing homogeneous regions within the document, grouping smaller components close to each other such as regions of text, and, if required, assigning it a category (e.g. a title or an image caption). Finally, TU [2] is an umbrella term for table detection and recognition: tables summarize important information within documents and their detection along with the recognition of their structure is crucial to automatically query collections of documents.\",\"refs\":[{\"start\":786,\"end\":789,\"marker\":\"bibr\",\"target\":\"#b0\"},{\"start\":1014,\"end\":1017,\"marker\":\"bibr\",\"target\":\"#b1\"}]},{\"text\":\"During the past years, the interest in the detection and recognition of tables raised significantly, leading to the automation of important processes such as information extraction. In particular, for scientific literature, it is crucial to extract tabular data, e.g. to make the research comparable and help scholars to reconstruct the SOTA of the different fields of study [3]. Moreover, collections of scientific papers such as arXiv and PubMed opened to the possibility of accessing a large number of documents along with their structural information represented in standard formats such as L A T E X and XML. That is why scientific literature parsing and scientific table analysis rapidly became one of the most prominent areas of research in DAR: large datasets have been released [4,5], allowing the community to develop deep learning models. Unfortunately, as we will describe in the next sections, these datasets come with partial information that forces the experimentation of layout analysis and table extraction separately. From this identified lack, we define Contextualized Table Extraction, a broad task that comes along with novel annotations for a collection of 75k scientific pages containing more than 35k tables, encouraging the development of new systems capable of tackling a multitude of tasks at once.\",\"refs\":[{\"start\":375,\"end\":378,\"marker\":\"bibr\",\"target\":\"#b2\"},{\"start\":787,\"end\":790,\"marker\":\"bibr\",\"target\":\"#b3\"},{\"start\":790,\"end\":792,\"marker\":\"bibr\",\"target\":\"#b4\"}]},{\"text\":\"In this paper, we introduce a new task called Contextualized Table Extraction that is a framework, which involves detecting tables, recognizing their structure, and performing functional analysis in an end-to-end manner. CTE is formulated as a token and link classification task, which allows for multiple tasks to be addressed simultaneously overcoming common limitations such as being performed separately or lacking a comprehensive dataset. CTE is built on top of well known tasks in DAR. CTE is designed to be suitable for methods employing Graph Neural Networks, which are widely used in applications where the structure and layout in documents matter. We provide a new set of labels structured in a way that allows us to merge information of selected scientific publications from other well known benchmark datasets. In this way we obtain a comprehensive dataset for the task of CTE. We believe that the combination of methods applied to process the labeled documents and produce the merged information collected is a novel contribution to the field of document analysis as well.\",\"refs\":[]}]},{\"title\":\"Related Work\",\"paragraphs\":[{\"text\":\"Despite the advances in the field, several challenges strongly limited the generalization of methods developed until a few years ago. In particular, we can mention: (i) data quality (e.g. scanned documents or images captured in-the-wild); (ii) contents, due to different languages and/or scripts; (iii) document layouts (which differentiate in, e.g. magazines, scientific papers, and invoices). To address these challenges a large number of data need to be collected in order to fully exploit the power of Deep Learning models that achieve the state-of-the-art for the aforementioned tasks. Unfortunately, creating such datasets is nothing but trivial since accurate annotations come at a high cost in terms of time and human effort [6,7]. On the other hand, automatic annotation techniques are not always applicable since they require a large number of documents shared together with their source files in standard formats such as L A T E X, XML, or HTML [8,4]. Additionally, these techniques usually generate weakly labeled collections and are more error-prone than manually annotated ones. Since online archives of scientific papers are freely and publicly available along with the corresponding source information (e.g. arXiv and PubMed) several datasets have been proposed so far in the field of scientific literature parsing. Among others, we summarize in Table 1 some of the most important datasets proposed for layout analysis and table extraction. PubLayNet and DocBank have been widely used to train object detectors [9,10] and transformers [11] for DLA. Overall, these datasets contain around half a million pages labeled into five and twelve different classes, respectively. PubLayNet has been constructed merging the information extracted from PDFMiner (bounding box regions) and the XML files shared by the publishers (containing the region labels). DocBank is built gathering the L A T E Xsource files and assigning labels taking into account the section tags. For the Table Extraction task, a recent dataset has been released (PubTables-1M) which counts nearly one million tables, labeled to perform not only TD and TSR but also Table Functional Analysis (TFA) that provides additional information on table cells like table headers. Even if it is smaller, SciTSR [12] introduced a collection of 15k tables generated from L A T E X to perform TSR, mainly using a Graph Neural Network (GNN). Despite this contribution, GNNs also have the advantage of being lightweight compared to transformer-based architectures while still retaining good performance, as shown in the framework Doc2Graph [13] for document analysis.\",\"refs\":[{\"start\":733,\"end\":736,\"marker\":\"bibr\",\"target\":\"#b5\"},{\"start\":736,\"end\":738,\"marker\":\"bibr\",\"target\":\"#b6\"},{\"start\":956,\"end\":959,\"marker\":\"bibr\",\"target\":\"#b7\"},{\"start\":959,\"end\":961,\"marker\":\"bibr\",\"target\":\"#b3\"},{\"start\":1368,\"end\":1369,\"marker\":\"table\",\"target\":\"#tab_0\"},{\"start\":1527,\"end\":1530,\"marker\":\"bibr\",\"target\":\"#b8\"},{\"start\":1530,\"end\":1533,\"marker\":\"bibr\",\"target\":\"#b9\"},{\"start\":1551,\"end\":1555,\"marker\":\"bibr\",\"target\":\"#b10\"},{\"start\":2279,\"end\":2283,\"marker\":\"bibr\",\"target\":\"#b11\"},{\"start\":2603,\"end\":2607,\"marker\":\"bibr\",\"target\":\"#b12\"}]},{\"text\":\"As it is possible to notice in Table 1, all these datasets lack a comprehensive and broader set of annotations, forcing the community to develop multiple systems that, in application scenarios, would lead to heavy and large pipelines.\",\"refs\":[{\"start\":37,\"end\":38,\"marker\":\"table\",\"target\":\"#tab_0\"}]}]},{\"title\":\"Contributions\",\"paragraphs\":[{\"text\":\"Our ongoing work brings several novelties, that are discussed throughout the paper and are summarized as follows:\",\"refs\":[]}]},{\"title\":\"• We define the task of Contextualized Table Extraction, an extended version of table\",\"paragraphs\":[{\"text\":\"extraction as defined in [5] that adds layout information and encourages the development of end-to-end systems that can tackle multiple tasks at once;\",\"refs\":[{\"start\":25,\"end\":28,\"marker\":\"bibr\",\"target\":\"#b4\"}]},{\"text\":\"• Novel annotations are created by merging subset of [4,5] that can be found in our repo 1 .\",\"refs\":[{\"start\":53,\"end\":56,\"marker\":\"bibr\",\"target\":\"#b3\"},{\"start\":56,\"end\":58,\"marker\":\"bibr\",\"target\":\"#b4\"},{\"start\":89,\"end\":90,\"marker\":null,\"target\":\"#foot_0\"}]},{\"text\":\"Our collection comprehends 75k scientific pages and more than 35k tables.

Indeed, in some fields of science (e.g., High Energy Physics), it is not infrequent to encounter hundreds or thousands of authors co-participating in the same piece of research [6]. Such intricate collaboration patterns make it particularly hard to establish a correct relationship between contributor and scientific contribution, and hence get an accurate and fair reward during research evaluation [7,8]. Thus, as widely known, scientific authorship tends to be a rather hot-button topic in academia as roughly one-fifth of academic disputes among authors stems from this [9].',\n",

However, the novel Open Science practices could be an opportunity to disrupt such dynamics and diversify the credit of the different scientific contributors involved in the diverse phases of the lifecycle of the same research effort. In fact, a paper and research data (or software) contextually published could exhibit different authorship to give credit to the various contributors right where it feels most appropriate.
